def get_group_index(
    labels, shape: Shape, sort: bool, xnull: bool
) -> npt.NDArray[np.int64]:
    """
    For the particular label_list, gets the offsets into the hypothetical list
    representing the totally ordered cartesian product of all possible label
    combinations, *as long as* this space fits within int64 bounds;
    otherwise, though group indices identify unique combinations of
    labels, they cannot be deconstructed.
    - If `sort`, rank of returned ids preserve lexical ranks of labels.
      i.e. returned id's can be used to do lexical sort on labels;
    - If `xnull` nulls (-1 labels) are passed through.

    Parameters
    ----------
    labels : sequence of arrays
        Integers identifying levels at each location
    shape : tuple[int, ...]
        Number of unique levels at each location
    sort : bool
        If the ranks of returned ids should match lexical ranks of labels
    xnull : bool
        If true nulls are excluded. i.e. -1 values in the labels are
        passed through.

    Returns
    -------
    An array of type int64 where two elements are equal if their corresponding
    labels are equal at all location.

    Notes
    -----
    The length of `labels` and `shape` must be identical.
