def lagdiv(c1, c2):
    """
    Divide one Laguerre series by another.

    Returns the quotient-with-remainder of two Laguerre series
    `c1` / `c2`.  The arguments are sequences of coefficients from lowest
    order "term" to highest, e.g., [1,2,3] represents the series
    ``P_0 + 2*P_1 + 3*P_2``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c1, c2 : array_like
        1-D arrays of Laguerre series coefficients ordered from low to
        high.

    Returns
    -------
    [quo, rem] : ndarrays
        Of Laguerre series coefficients representing the quotient and
        remainder.

    --------
    lagadd, lagsub, lagmulx, lagmul, lagpow

    Notes
    -----
    In general, the (polynomial) division of one Laguerre series by another
    results in quotient and remainder terms that are not in the Laguerre
    polynomial basis set.  Thus, to express these results as a Laguerre
    series, it is necessary to "reproject" the results onto the Laguerre
    basis set, which may produce "unintuitive" (but correct) results; see
    Examples section below.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial.laguerre import lagdiv
    >>> lagdiv([  8., -13.,  38., -51.,  36.], [0, 1, 2])
    (array([1., 2., 3.]), array([0.]))
    >>> lagdiv([  9., -12.,  38., -51.,  36.], [0, 1, 2])
    (array([1., 2., 3.]), array([1., 1.]))
