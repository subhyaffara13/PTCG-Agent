    Python distributed by Apple's Command Line Tools has this special scheme
    that's used when:

    * This is a framework build.
    * We are installing into the system prefix.

    This does not account for ``pip install --prefix`` (also means we're not
    installing to the system prefix), which should use ``posix_prefix``, but
    logic here means ``_infer_prefix()`` outputs ``osx_framework_library``. But
    since ``prefix`` is not available for ``sysconfig.get_default_scheme()``,
    which is the stdlib replacement for ``_infer_prefix()``, presumably Apple
    wouldn't be able to magically switch between ``osx_framework_library`` and
    ``posix_prefix``. ``_infer_prefix()`` returning ``osx_framework_library``
    means its behavior is consistent whether we use the stdlib implementation
    or our own, and we deal with this special case in ``get_scheme()`` instead.
