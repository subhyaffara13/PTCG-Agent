    Builds a mask for the aspect ratios of the images.

    Args:
        aspect_ratios (`List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]`):
            A list of lists containing aspect ratios for each image in the batch.
            Each aspect ratio is represented as a tuple of (width, height) in terms of number of tiles.
        max_image_tiles (`int`):
            The maximum number of tiles any image can be split into.
        device (`torch.device`, *optional*):
            The device to create the tensor on. Defaults to CPU.

    Returns:
        `torch.Tensor`: A 3D torch.Tensor of shape (batch_size, max_num_images, max_image_tiles).
            The mask contains 1s for valid tiles and 0s for padding.
