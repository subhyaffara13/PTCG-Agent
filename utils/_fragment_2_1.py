    A helper function for expm_2009.

    Notes
    -----
    The argument X is modified in-place, but this modification is not the same
    as the returned value of the function.
    This function also takes pains to do things in ways that are compatible
    with sparse arrays, for example by avoiding fancy indexing
    and by using methods of the matrices whenever possible instead of
    using functions of the numpy or scipy libraries themselves.
