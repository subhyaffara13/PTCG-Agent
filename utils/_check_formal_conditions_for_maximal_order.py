    Several functions in this module accept an argument which is to be a
    :py:class:`~.Submodule` representing the maximal order in a number field,
    such as returned by the :py:func:`~sympy.polys.numberfields.basis.round_two`
    algorithm.

    We do not attempt to check that the given ``Submodule`` actually represents
    a maximal order, but we do check a basic set of formal conditions that the
    ``Submodule`` must satisfy, at a minimum. The purpose is to catch an
    obviously ill-formed argument.
