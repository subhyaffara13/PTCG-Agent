def resolve_types(
    cls, globalns=None, localns=None, attribs=None, include_extras=True
):
    """
    Resolve any strings and forward annotations in type annotations.

    This is only required if you need concrete types in :class:`Attribute`'s
    *type* field. In other words, you don't need to resolve your types if you
    only use them for static type checking.

    With no arguments, names will be looked up in the module in which the class
    was created. If this is not what you want, for example, if the name only
    exists inside a method, you may pass *globalns* or *localns* to specify
    other dictionaries in which to look up these names. See the docs of
    `typing.get_type_hints` for more details.

    Args:
        cls (type): Class to resolve.

        globalns (dict | None): Dictionary containing global variables.

        localns (dict | None): Dictionary containing local variables.

        attribs (list | None):
            List of attribs for the given class. This is necessary when calling
            from inside a ``field_transformer`` since *cls* is not an *attrs*
            class yet.

        include_extras (bool):
            Resolve more accurately, if possible. Pass ``include_extras`` to
            ``typing.get_hints``, if supported by the typing module. On
            supported Python versions (3.9+), this resolves the types more
            accurately.

    Raises:
        TypeError: If *cls* is not a class.

        attrs.exceptions.NotAnAttrsClassError:
            If *cls* is not an *attrs* class and you didn't pass any attribs.

        NameError: If types cannot be resolved because of missing variables.

    Returns:
        *cls* so you can use this function also as a class decorator. Please
        note that you have to apply it **after** `attrs.define`. That means the
        decorator has to come in the line **before** `attrs.define`.
