def dynamicsymbols(names, level=0, **assumptions):
    """Uses symbols and Function for functions of time.

    Creates a SymPy UndefinedFunction, which is then initialized as a function
    of a variable, the default being Symbol('t').

    Parameters
    ==========

    names : str
        Names of the dynamic symbols you want to create; works the same way as
        inputs to symbols
    level : int
        Level of differentiation of the returned function; d/dt once of t,
        twice of t, etc.
    assumptions :
        - real(bool) : This is used to set the dynamicsymbol as real,
                    by default is False.
        - positive(bool) : This is used to set the dynamicsymbol as positive,
                    by default is False.
        - commutative(bool) : This is used to set the commutative property of
                    a dynamicsymbol, by default is True.
        - integer(bool) : This is used to set the dynamicsymbol as integer,
                    by default is False.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.physics.vector import dynamicsymbols
    >>> from sympy import diff, Symbol
    >>> q1 = dynamicsymbols('q1')
    >>> q1

    >>> q2.is_real
    True
    >>> q3 = dynamicsymbols('q3', positive=True)
    >>> q3.is_positive
    True
    >>> q4, q5 = dynamicsymbols('q4,q5', commutative=False)
    >>> bool(q4*q5 != q5*q4)
    True
    >>> q6 = dynamicsymbols('q6', integer=True)
    >>> q6.is_integer
    True
    >>> diff(q1, Symbol('t'))
    Derivative(q1(t), t)
