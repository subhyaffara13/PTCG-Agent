def filter_overlapping(tokens):
    """
    Return a new list from an iterable of `tokens` discarding contained and
    overlaping Tokens using these rules:

    - skip a token fully contained in another token.
    - keep the biggest, left-most token of two overlapping tokens and skip the other

    For example:
    >>> tokens = [
    ...     Token(0, 0, 'a'),
    ...     Token(1, 5, 'bcdef'),
    ...     Token(2, 4, 'cde'),

    ...     Token(4, 7, 'efgh'),
    ...     Token(8, 9, 'ij'),
    ...     Token(10, 13, 'klmn'),
    ...     Token(11, 15, 'lmnop'),
    ...     Token(16, 16, 'q'),
    ... ]

    >>> expected = [
    ...     Token(0, 0, 'a'),
    ...     Token(1, 5, 'bcdef'),
