    Blit directly from a array values.

    Directly copy values from an array into a Surface. This is faster than
    converting the array into a Surface and blitting. The array must be the
    same dimensions as the Surface and will completely replace all pixel
    values. Only integer, ascii character and record arrays are accepted.

    This function will temporarily lock the Surface as the new values are
    copied.
