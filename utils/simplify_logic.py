def simplify_logic(expr, form=None, deep=True, force=False, dontcare=None):
    """
    This function simplifies a boolean function to its simplified version
    in SOP or POS form. The return type is an :py:class:`~.Or` or
    :py:class:`~.And` object in SymPy.

    Parameters
    ==========

    expr : Boolean

    form : string (``'cnf'`` or ``'dnf'``) or ``None`` (default).
        If ``'cnf'`` or ``'dnf'``, the simplest expression in the corresponding
        normal form is returned; if ``None``, the answer is returned
        according to the form with fewest args (in CNF by default).

    deep : bool (default ``True``)
        Indicates whether to recursively simplify any
        non-boolean functions contained within the input.

    force : bool (default ``False``)
        As the simplifications require exponential time in the number
        of variables, there is by default a limit on expressions with
        8 variables. When the expression has more than 8 variables
        only symbolical simplification (controlled by ``deep``) is
        made. By setting ``force`` to ``True``, this limit is removed. Be
        aware that this can lead to very long simplification times.

    dontcare : Boolean
        Optimize expression under the assumption that inputs where this
        expression is true are don't care. This is useful in e.g. Piecewise
        conditions, where later conditions do not need to consider inputs that
        are converted by previous conditions. For example, if a previous
        condition is ``And(A, B)``, the simplification of expr can be made
        with don't cares for ``And(A, B)``.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.logic import simplify_logic
    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y, z
    >>> b = (~x & ~y & ~z) | ( ~x & ~y & z)
    >>> simplify_logic(b)
    ~x & ~y
    >>> simplify_logic(x | y, dontcare=y)
    x
