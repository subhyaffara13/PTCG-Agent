    dict as returned by floyd_warshall_predecessor_and_distance

    Parameters
    ----------
    source : node
       Starting node for path

    target : node
       Ending node for path

    predecessors: dictionary
       Dictionary, keyed by source and target, of predecessors in the
       shortest path, as returned by floyd_warshall_predecessor_and_distance

    Returns
    -------
    path : list
       A list of nodes containing the shortest path from source to target

       If source and target are the same, an empty list is returned
