def is_kl_connected(G, k, l, low_memory=False):
    """Returns True if and only if `G` is locally `(k, l)`-connected.

    A graph is locally `(k, l)`-connected if for each edge `(u, v)` in the
    graph there are at least `l` edge-disjoint paths of length at most `k`
    joining `u` to `v`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
        The graph to test for local `(k, l)`-connectedness.

    k : integer
        The maximum length of paths to consider. A higher number means a looser
        connectivity requirement.

    l : integer
        The number of edge-disjoint paths. A higher number means a stricter
        connectivity requirement.

    low_memory : bool
        If this is True, this function uses an algorithm that uses slightly
        more time but less memory.

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        Whether the graph is locally `(k, l)`-connected subgraph.
