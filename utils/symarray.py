def symarray(prefix, shape, **kwargs):  # pragma: no cover
    r"""Create a numpy ndarray of symbols (as an object array).

    The created symbols are named ``prefix_i1_i2_``...  You should thus provide a
    non-empty prefix if you want your symbols to be unique for different output
    arrays, as SymPy symbols with identical names are the same object.

    Parameters
    ----------

    prefix : string
      A prefix prepended to the name of every symbol.

    shape : int or tuple
      Shape of the created array.  If an int, the array is one-dimensional; for
      more than one dimension the shape must be a tuple.

    \*\*kwargs : dict
      keyword arguments passed on to Symbol

    Examples
    ========
    These doctests require numpy.

    >>> from sympy import symarray
    >>> symarray('', 3)
    [_0 _1 _2]

    If you want multiple symarrays to contain distinct symbols, you *must*
    provide unique prefixes:

    >>> a = symarray('', 3)
    >>> b = symarray('', 3)
    >>> a[0] == b[0]
    True
    >>> a = symarray('a', 3)
    >>> b = symarray('b', 3)
    >>> a[0] == b[0]
    False

    Creating symarrays with a prefix:

    >>> symarray('a', 3)
    [a_0 a_1 a_2]

    For more than one dimension, the shape must be given as a tuple:

    >>> symarray('a', (2, 3))
    [[a_0_0 a_0_1 a_0_2]
     [a_1_0 a_1_1 a_1_2]]
    >>> symarray('a', (2, 3, 2))
    [[[a_0_0_0 a_0_0_1]
      [a_0_1_0 a_0_1_1]
      [a_0_2_0 a_0_2_1]]
    <BLANKLINE>
     [[a_1_0_0 a_1_0_1]
      [a_1_1_0 a_1_1_1]
      [a_1_2_0 a_1_2_1]]]

    For setting assumptions of the underlying Symbols:

    >>> [s.is_real for s in symarray('a', 2, real=True)]
    [True, True]
    """
    from numpy import empty, ndindex
    arr = empty(shape, dtype=object)
    for index in ndindex(shape):
        arr[index] = Symbol('%s_%s' % (prefix, '_'.join(map(str, index))),
                            **kwargs)
    return arr
