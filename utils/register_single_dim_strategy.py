    Registers a single_dim_strategy function for the given op.

    A single_dim_strategy enumerates all the non-trivial sharding specifications for the operator over a single mesh
    dim. Since it generates the full set of valid shardings regardless of the given input placements, tensor inputs
    are represented via TensorMetas instead of OpStrategies like in op_strategy functions. TensorMeta inputs, along
    with all other op inputs (int, float, bool, etc) inform which sharding placements are valid. Single-dim strategies
    are fed into infra that expands them over multiple mesh dims and fills sharding placeholders with concrete sharding
    types.

    Single-dim-strategies should not list the trivial "all Replicate" rule, which is assumed for all ops.

    Sharding placeholders should be used to represent generic sharding rules in single_dim_strategies.  For example,
    most operators that support sharded inputs and outputs do not care how the shards are laid out globally, as long as
    they are consistent.  It is just as valid to run a matmul on (Shard(0), Replicate -> Shard(0)) as on
    (StridedShard(0), Replicate -> StridedShard(0)).  For this reason, we use a 'ShardingPlaceholder' to represent all
    generic sharding types.  Placeholders will be filled by concrete sharding types seen in runtime inputs, not all
    types known to DTensor.
