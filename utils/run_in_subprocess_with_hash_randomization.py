    """
    Run a function in a Python subprocess with hash randomization enabled.

    If hash randomization is not supported by the version of Python given, it
    returns False.  Otherwise, it returns the exit value of the command.  The
    function is passed to sys.exit(), so the return value of the function will
    be the return value.

    The environment variable PYTHONHASHSEED is used to seed Python's hash
    randomization.  If it is set, this function will return False, because
    starting a new subprocess is unnecessary in that case.  If it is not set,
    one is set at random, and the tests are run.  Note that if this
    environment variable is set when Python starts, hash randomization is
    automatically enabled.  To force a subprocess to be created even if
    PYTHONHASHSEED is set, pass ``force=True``.  This flag will not force a
    subprocess in Python versions that do not support hash randomization (see
    below), because those versions of Python do not support the ``-R`` flag.

    ``function`` should be a string name of a function that is importable from
    the module ``module``, like "_test".  The default for ``module`` is
    "sympy.testing.runtests".  ``function_args`` and ``function_kwargs``
    should be a repr-able tuple and dict, respectively.  The default Python
    command is sys.executable, which is the currently running Python command.

    This function is necessary because the seed for hash randomization must be
    set by the environment variable before Python starts.  Hence, in order to
    use a predetermined seed for tests, we must start Python in a separate
    subprocess.

    Hash randomization was added in the minor Python versions 2.6.8, 2.7.3,
    3.1.5, and 3.2.3, and is enabled by default in all Python versions after
    and including 3.3.0.
