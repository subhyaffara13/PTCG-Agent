def lpmin(f, constr):
    """return minimum of linear equation ``f`` under
    linear constraints expressed using Ge, Le or Eq.

    All variables are unbounded unless constrained.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.solvers.simplex import lpmin
    >>> from sympy import Eq
    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y
    >>> lpmin(x, [2*x - 3*y >= -1, Eq(x + 3*y, 2), x <= 2*y])
    (1/3, {x: 1/3, y: 5/9})

    Negative values for variables are permitted unless explicitly
    excluding, so minimizing ``x`` for ``x <= 3`` is an
    unbounded problem while the following has a bounded solution:

    >>> lpmin(x, [x >= 0, x <= 3])
    (0, {x: 0})

    Without indicating that ``x`` is nonnegative, there
    is no minimum for this objective:

    >>> lpmin(x, [x <= 3])
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    sympy.solvers.simplex.UnboundedLPError:
    Objective function can assume arbitrarily large values!
