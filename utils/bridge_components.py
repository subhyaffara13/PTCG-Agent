def bridge_components(G):
    """Finds all bridge-connected components G.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX undirected graph

    Returns
    -------
    bridge_components : a generator of 2-edge-connected components


    See Also
    --------
    :func:`k_edge_subgraphs` : this function is a special case for an
        undirected graph where k=2.
    :func:`biconnected_components` : similar to this function, but is defined
        using 2-node-connectivity instead of 2-edge-connectivity.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXNotImplemented
        If the input graph is directed or a multigraph.

    Notes
    -----
    Bridge-connected components are also known as 2-edge-connected components.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> # The barbell graph with parameter zero has a single bridge
    >>> G = nx.barbell_graph(5, 0)
    >>> from networkx.algorithms.connectivity.edge_kcomponents import bridge_components
    >>> sorted(map(sorted, bridge_components(G)))
    [[0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]]

    H = G.copy()
    H.remove_edges_from(nx.bridges(G))
    yield from nx.connected_components(H)
