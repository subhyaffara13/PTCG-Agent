def _af_rmul(a, b):
    """
    Return the product b*a; input and output are array forms. The ith value
    is a[b[i]].

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.combinatorics.permutations import _af_rmul, Permutation

    >>> a, b = [1, 0, 2], [0, 2, 1]
    >>> _af_rmul(a, b)
    [1, 2, 0]
    >>> [a[b[i]] for i in range(3)]
    [1, 2, 0]

    This handles the operands in reverse order compared to the ``*`` operator:

    >>> a = Permutation(a)
    >>> b = Permutation(b)
    >>> list(a*b)
    [2, 0, 1]
    >>> [b(a(i)) for i in range(3)]
    [2, 0, 1]
