    """Create a Set-Cookie header without the ``Set-Cookie`` prefix.

    The return value is usually restricted to ascii as the vast majority
    of values are properly escaped, but that is no guarantee. It's
    tunneled through latin1 as required by :pep:`3333`.

    The return value is not ASCII safe if the key contains unicode
    characters.  This is technically against the specification but
    happens in the wild.  It's strongly recommended to not use
    non-ASCII values for the keys.

    :param max_age: should be a number of seconds, or `None` (default) if
                    the cookie should last only as long as the client's
                    browser session.  Additionally `timedelta` objects
                    are accepted, too.
    :param expires: should be a `datetime` object or unix timestamp.
    :param path: limits the cookie to a given path, per default it will
                 span the whole domain.
    :param domain: Use this if you want to set a cross-domain cookie. For
                   example, ``domain="example.com"`` will set a cookie
                   that is readable by the domain ``www.example.com``,
                   ``foo.example.com`` etc. Otherwise, a cookie will only
                   be readable by the domain that set it.
    :param secure: The cookie will only be available via HTTPS
    :param httponly: disallow JavaScript to access the cookie.  This is an
                     extension to the cookie standard and probably not
                     supported by all browsers.
    :param charset: the encoding for string values.
    :param sync_expires: automatically set expires if max_age is defined
                         but expires not.
    :param max_size: Warn if the final header value exceeds this size. The
        default, 4093, should be safely `supported by most browsers
        <cookie_>`_. Set to 0 to disable this check.
    :param samesite: Limits the scope of the cookie such that it will
        only be attached to requests if those requests are same-site.
    :param partitioned: Opts the cookie into partitioned storage. This
        will also set secure to True

    .. versionchanged:: 3.1
        The ``partitioned`` parameter was added.

    .. versionchanged:: 3.0
        Passing bytes, and the ``charset`` parameter, were removed.

    .. versionchanged:: 2.3.3
        The ``path`` parameter is ``/`` by default.

    .. versionchanged:: 2.3.1
        The value allows more characters without quoting.

    .. versionchanged:: 2.3
        ``localhost`` and other names without a dot are allowed for the domain. A
        leading dot is ignored.

    .. versionchanged:: 2.3
        The ``path`` parameter is ``None`` by default.

    .. versionchanged:: 1.0.0
        The string ``'None'`` is accepted for ``samesite``.
