    # When we trace through a torch.tensor invocation, you never actually

    # implemented internally is that we allocate a plain tensor (this is
    # *guaranteed* to be a plain tensor, we disable all modes when doing
    # so), and then call at::lift_fresh on it (to give modes a chance to do
    # their stuff).  Furthermore, the tensor argument to lift_fresh is guaranteed
    # to be freshly allocated, so we want lift_fresh to be a no-op (directly
    # returning the input argument).
    #
    # Here is the basic problem: when we trace this sequence of executions
    # into an FX graph, what happens to this call sequence?  Traditionally,
    # tensor constants get interned as buffers on the FX GraphModule.  But
    # this is dangerous.  Consider:
    #
    #       x = torch.tensor(1)

    #       x = torch.ops.aten.lift_fresh(t)
    #       x.add_(2)
    #
    # If lift_fresh returns t directly, the subsequent add_ call will
    # modify the tensor constant. Really, the problem is we've violated
    # the invariant the argument to lift is fresh.  So what we should
    # preserve the invariant by replacing lift_fresh with lift_fresh_copy:
    #
    #       t = self._tensor_constant0  # initialized to torch.tensor(1)
    #       x = torch.ops.aten.lift_fresh_copy(t)
    #       x.add_(2)

    # helpful to due constant propagation in case we call item() (in which
