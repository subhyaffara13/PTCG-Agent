def _symbol(s, matching_symbol=None, **assumptions):
    """Return s if s is a Symbol, else if s is a string, return either
    the matching_symbol if the names are the same or else a new symbol
    with the same assumptions as the matching symbol (or the
    assumptions as provided).

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import Symbol
    >>> from sympy.core.symbol import _symbol
    >>> _symbol('y')
    y
    >>> _.is_real is None
    True
    >>> _symbol('y', real=True).is_real
    True

    >>> x = Symbol('x')
    >>> _symbol(x, real=True)
    x
    >>> _.is_real is None  # ignore attribute if s is a Symbol
    True

    Below, the variable sym has the name 'foo':

    >>> sym = Symbol('foo', real=True)

    Since 'x' is not the same as sym's name, a new symbol is created:

    >>> _symbol('x', sym).name
    'x'

    It will acquire any assumptions give:

    >>> _symbol('x', sym, real=False).is_real
    False

    Since 'foo' is the same as sym's name, sym is returned

    >>> _symbol('foo', sym)
    foo

    Any assumptions given are ignored:

    >>> _symbol('foo', sym, real=False).is_real
    True

    NB: the symbol here may not be the same as a symbol with the same
    name defined elsewhere as a result of different assumptions.
