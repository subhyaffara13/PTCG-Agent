    Determine if one node depends on another in a torch.fx.Graph.

        a: The node that may have a dependency on b.
        b: The node that a may have a dependency on.
        search_depth: In the case of an indirect dependency, this function
                        searches upto this many nodes away in search of a
                        data dependency. If none is found, the function
                        makes the conservative assumption that there is a
