def iterable(i, exclude=(str, dict, NotIterable)):
    """
    Return a boolean indicating whether ``i`` is SymPy iterable.
    True also indicates that the iterator is finite, e.g. you can
    call list(...) on the instance.

    When SymPy is working with iterables, it is almost always assuming
    that the iterable is not a string or a mapping, so those are excluded
    by default. If you want a pure Python definition, make exclude=None. To
    exclude multiple items, pass them as a tuple.

    You can also set the _iterable attribute to True or False on your class,
    which will override the checks here, including the exclude test.

    As a rule of thumb, some SymPy functions use this to check if they should
    recursively map over an object. If an object is technically iterable in
    the Python sense but does not desire this behavior (e.g., because its
    iteration is not finite, or because iteration might induce an unwanted
    computation), it should disable it by setting the _iterable attribute to False.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.utilities.iterables import iterable
    >>> from sympy import Tuple
    >>> things = [[1], (1,), set([1]), Tuple(1), (j for j in [1, 2]), {1:2}, '1', 1]
    >>> for i in things:
    ...     print('%s %s' % (iterable(i), type(i)))
    True <... 'list'>
    True <... 'tuple'>
    True <... 'set'>
    True <class 'sympy.core.containers.Tuple'>
    True <... 'generator'>
    False <... 'dict'>
    False <... 'str'>
    False <... 'int'>

    >>> iterable({}, exclude=None)
    True
    >>> iterable({}, exclude=str)
    True
    >>> iterable("no", exclude=str)
    False

def iterable(y):
    """
    Check whether or not an object can be iterated over.

    Parameters
    ----------
    y : object
      Input object.

    Returns
    -------
    b : bool
      Return ``True`` if the object has an iterator method or is a
      sequence and ``False`` otherwise.


    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> np.iterable([1, 2, 3])
    True
    >>> np.iterable(2)
    False

    Notes
    -----
    In most cases, the results of ``np.iterable(obj)`` are consistent with
    ``isinstance(obj, collections.abc.Iterable)``. One notable exception is
    the treatment of 0-dimensional arrays::

        >>> from collections.abc import Iterable
        >>> a = np.array(1.0)  # 0-dimensional numpy array
        >>> isinstance(a, Iterable)
        True
        >>> np.iterable(a)
        False
