def decipher_affine(msg, key, symbols=None):
    r"""
    Return the deciphered text that was made from the mapping,
    `x \rightarrow ax+b` (mod `N`), where ``N`` is the
    number of characters in the alphabet. Deciphering is done by
    reciphering with a new key: `x \rightarrow cx+d` (mod `N`),
    where `c = a^{-1}` (mod `N`) and `d = -a^{-1}b` (mod `N`).

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.crypto.crypto import encipher_affine, decipher_affine
    >>> msg = "GO NAVY BEAT ARMY"
    >>> key = (3, 1)
    >>> encipher_affine(msg, key)
    'TROBMVENBGBALV'
    >>> decipher_affine(_, key)
    'GONAVYBEATARMY'
