def JointRV(symbol, pdf, _set=None):
    """
    Create a Joint Random Variable where each of its component is continuous,
    given the following:

    Parameters
    ==========

    symbol : Symbol
        Represents name of the random variable.
    pdf : A PDF in terms of indexed symbols of the symbol given
        as the first argument

    NOTE
    ====

    As of now, the set for each component for a ``JointRV`` is
    equal to the set of all integers, which cannot be changed.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import exp, pi, Indexed, S
    >>> from sympy.stats import density, JointRV
    >>> x1, x2 = (Indexed('x', i) for i in (1, 2))
    >>> pdf = exp(-x1**2/2 + x1 - x2**2/2 - S(1)/2)/(2*pi)
    >>> N1 = JointRV('x', pdf) #Multivariate Normal distribution
    >>> density(N1)(1, 2)
    exp(-2)/(2*pi)

    Returns
    =======
