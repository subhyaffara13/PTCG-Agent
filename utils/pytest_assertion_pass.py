    """Called whenever an assertion passes.

    .. versionadded:: 5.0

    Use this hook to do some processing after a passing assertion.
    The original assertion information is available in the `orig` string
    and the pytest introspected assertion information is available in the
    `expl` string.

    This hook must be explicitly enabled by the :confval:`enable_assertion_pass_hook`
    configuration option:

    .. tab:: toml

        .. code-block:: toml

            [pytest]
            enable_assertion_pass_hook = true

    .. tab:: ini

        .. code-block:: ini

            [pytest]
            enable_assertion_pass_hook = true

    You need to **clean the .pyc** files in your project directory and interpreter libraries
    when enabling this option, as assertions will require to be re-written.

    :param item: pytest item object of current test.
    :param lineno: Line number of the assert statement.
    :param orig: String with the original assertion.
    :param expl: String with the assert explanation.

    Use in conftest plugins
    =======================

    Any conftest file can implement this hook. For a given item, only conftest
    files in the item's directory and its parent directories are consulted.
