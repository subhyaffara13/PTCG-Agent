def memory_stats(device_index: _device_t = None, /) -> OrderedDict[str, Any]:
    r"""Return a dictionary of accelerator device memory allocator statistics for a given device index.

    The return value of this function is a dictionary of statistics, each of
    which is a non-negative integer.

    Core statistics:

    - ``"allocated.{all,large_pool,small_pool}.{current,peak,allocated,freed}"``:
      number of allocation requests received by the memory allocator.
    - ``"allocated_bytes.{all,large_pool,small_pool}.{current,peak,allocated,freed}"``:
      amount of allocated memory.
    - ``"segment.{all,large_pool,small_pool}.{current,peak,allocated,freed}"``:
      number of reserved segments from device memory allocation.
    - ``"reserved_bytes.{all,large_pool,small_pool}.{current,peak,allocated,freed}"``:
      amount of reserved memory.
    - ``"active.{all,large_pool,small_pool}.{current,peak,allocated,freed}"``:
      number of active memory blocks.
    - ``"active_bytes.{all,large_pool,small_pool}.{current,peak,allocated,freed}"``:
      amount of active memory.
    - ``"inactive_split.{all,large_pool,small_pool}.{current,peak,allocated,freed}"``:
      number of inactive, non-releasable memory blocks.
    - ``"inactive_split_bytes.{all,large_pool,small_pool}.{current,peak,allocated,freed}"``:
      amount of inactive, non-releasable memory.

    For these core statistics, values are broken down as follows.

    Pool type:

    - ``all``: combined statistics across all memory pools.
    - ``large_pool``: statistics for the large allocation pool
      (as of June 2025, for size >= 1MB allocations).
    - ``small_pool``: statistics for the small allocation pool
      (as of June 2025, for size < 1MB allocations).

    Metric type:

    - ``current``: current value of this metric.
    - ``peak``: maximum value of this metric.
    - ``allocated``: historical total increase in this metric.
    - ``freed``: historical total decrease in this metric.

    In addition to the core statistics, we also provide some simple event
    counters:

    - ``"num_alloc_retries"``: number of failed device memory allocation calls that
      result in a cache flush and retry.
    - ``"num_ooms"``: number of out-of-memory errors thrown.
    - ``"num_sync_all_streams"``: number of ``synchronize_and_free_events`` calls.
    - ``"num_device_alloc"``: number of device memory allocation calls.
    - ``"num_device_free"``: number of device memory free calls.

    Args:
        device_index (:class:`torch.device`, str, int, optional): the index of the device to target.
            If not given, use :func:`torch.accelerator.current_device_index` by default.
            If a :class:`torch.device` or str is provided, its type must match the current
            :ref:`accelerator<accelerators>` device type.

    Returns:
        OrderedDict[str, Any]: an ordered dictionary mapping statistic names to their values.

    The caching allocator can be configured via ENV to not split blocks larger than a
    defined size (see Memory Management section of the Cuda Semantics documentation).
    This helps avoid memory fragmentation but may have a performance
    penalty. Additional outputs to assist with tuning and evaluating impact:

    - ``"max_split_size"``: blocks above this size will not be split.
    - ``"oversize_allocations.{current,peak,allocated,freed}"``:
      number of over-size allocation requests received by the memory allocator.
    - ``"oversize_segments.{current,peak,allocated,freed}"``:
      number of over-size reserved segments from ``cudaMalloc()``.

    The caching allocator can be configured via ENV to round memory allocations in order
    to reduce fragmentation. Sometimes the overhead from rounding can be higher than
    the fragmentation it helps reduce. The following stat can be used to check if
    rounding adds too much overhead:

    - ``"requested_bytes.{all,large_pool,small_pool}.{current,peak,allocated,freed}"``:
      memory requested by client code, compare this with allocated_bytes to check if
      allocation rounding adds too much overhead.

    Args:
        device (torch.device or int, optional): selected device. Returns
            statistics for the current device, given by :func:`~torch.cuda.current_device`,
            if :attr:`device` is ``None`` (default).

    .. note::
        See :ref:`cuda-memory-management` for more details about GPU memory
        management.

    .. note::
        With :ref:`backend:cudaMallocAsync<cuda-memory-envvars>`, some stats are not
        meaningful, and are always reported as zero.
