def AbelianGroup(*cyclic_orders):
    """
    Returns the direct product of cyclic groups with the given orders.

    Explanation
    ===========

    According to the structure theorem for finite abelian groups ([1]),
    every finite abelian group can be written as the direct product of
    finitely many cyclic groups.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.combinatorics.named_groups import AbelianGroup
    >>> AbelianGroup(3, 4)
    PermutationGroup([
            (6)(0 1 2),
            (3 4 5 6)])
    >>> _.is_group
    True
