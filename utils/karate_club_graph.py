def karate_club_graph():
    """Returns Zachary's Karate Club graph.

    Each node in the returned graph has a node attribute 'club' that
    indicates the name of the club to which the member represented by that node
    belongs, either 'Mr. Hi' or 'Officer'. Each edge has a weight based on the
    number of contexts in which that edge's incident node members interacted.

    The dataset is derived from the 'Club After Split From Data' column of Table 3 in [1]_.
    This was in turn derived from the 'Club After Fission' column of Table 1 in the
    same paper. Note that the nodes are 0-indexed in NetworkX, but 1-indexed in the
    paper (the 'Individual Number in Matrix C' column of Table 3 starts at 1). This
    means, for example, that ``G.nodes[9]["club"]`` returns 'Officer', which
    corresponds to row 10 of Table 3 in the paper.

    Examples
    --------
    To get the name of the club to which a node belongs:

    >>> G = nx.karate_club_graph()
    >>> G.nodes[5]["club"]
    'Mr. Hi'
    >>> G.nodes[9]["club"]
    'Officer'
