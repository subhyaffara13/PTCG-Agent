    """Securely hash a password for storage. A password can be compared to a stored hash
    using :func:`check_password_hash`.

    The following methods are supported:

    -   ``scrypt``, the default. The parameters are ``n``, ``r``, and ``p``, the default
        is ``scrypt:32768:8:1``. See :func:`hashlib.scrypt`.
    -   ``pbkdf2``, less secure. The parameters are ``hash_method`` and ``iterations``,
        the default is ``pbkdf2:sha256:600000``. See :func:`hashlib.pbkdf2_hmac`.

    Default parameters may be updated to reflect current guidelines, and methods may be
    deprecated and removed if they are no longer considered secure. To migrate old
    hashes, you may generate a new hash when checking an old hash, or you may contact
    users with a link to reset their password.

    :param password: The plaintext password.
    :param method: The key derivation function and parameters.
    :param salt_length: The number of characters to generate for the salt.

    .. versionchanged:: 3.1
        The default iterations for pbkdf2 was increased to 1,000,000.

    .. versionchanged:: 2.3
        Scrypt support was added.

    .. versionchanged:: 2.3
        The default iterations for pbkdf2 was increased to 600,000.

    .. versionchanged:: 2.3
        All plain hashes are deprecated and will not be supported in Werkzeug 3.0.
