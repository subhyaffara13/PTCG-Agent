def find_minimal_d_separator(G, x, y, *, included=None, restricted=None):
    """Returns a minimal d-separating set between `x` and `y` if possible

    A d-separating set in a DAG is a set of nodes that blocks all
    paths between the two sets of nodes, `x` and `y`. This function
    constructs a d-separating set that is "minimal", meaning no nodes can
    be removed without it losing the d-separating property for `x` and `y`.
    If no d-separating sets exist for `x` and `y`, this returns `None`.

    In a DAG there may be more than one minimal d-separator between two
    sets of nodes. Minimal d-separators are not always unique. This function
    returns one minimal d-separator, or `None` if no d-separator exists.

    Uses the algorithm presented in [1]_. The complexity of the algorithm
    is :math:`O(m)`, where :math:`m` stands for the number of edges in
    the subgraph of G consisting of only the ancestors of `x` and `y`.
    For full details, see [1]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
        A networkx DAG.
    x : set | node
        A node or set of nodes in the graph.
    y : set | node
        A node or set of nodes in the graph.
    included : set | node | None
        A node or set of nodes which must be included in the found separating set,
        default is None, which means the empty set.
    restricted : set | node | None
        Restricted node or set of nodes to consider. Only these nodes can be in
        the found separating set, default is None meaning all nodes in ``G``.

    Returns
    -------
    z : set | None
        The minimal d-separating set, if at least one d-separating set exists,
        otherwise None.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        Raises a :exc:`NetworkXError` if the input graph is not a DAG
        or if node sets `x`, `y`, and `included` are not disjoint.

    NodeNotFound
        If any of the input nodes are not found in the graph,
        a :exc:`NodeNotFound` exception is raised.
