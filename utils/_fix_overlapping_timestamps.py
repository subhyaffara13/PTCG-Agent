    CUPTI can produce slightly overlapping timestamps for consecutive graphed
    events, causing Perfetto to hide events that sit entirely "under" their
    neighbours.  This pass sorts graphed work events per stream and ensures
    each event starts at or after the previous event's end.

    Overlaps larger than *max_adjust_us* are flagged as warnings and left
    unchanged, since they likely indicate a real issue rather than CUPTI
    timestamp jitter.
