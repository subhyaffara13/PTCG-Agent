    """ Transforms all the equals signs ``=`` to instances of Eq.

    Parses the equals signs in the expression and replaces them with
    appropriate Eq instances. Also works with nested equals signs.

    Does not yet play well with function arguments.
    For example, the expression ``(x=y)`` is ambiguous and can be interpreted
    as x being an argument to a function and ``convert_equals_signs`` will not
    work for this.
