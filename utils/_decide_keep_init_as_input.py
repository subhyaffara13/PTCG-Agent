    """Decides whether the initializers in the graph should be listed as ONNX graph inputs.

    This method encapsulates the logic to decide whether the initializers in the graph
    should be listed as ONNX graph inputs (i.e., whether to choose ONNX IR v3 or v4).
    If keep_initializers_as_inputs is not specified (None), then we decide whether to keep
    initializers as graph inputs (val_keep_init_as_ip) based on export type. If export type
    is ONNX, then do not keep initializers as input (val_keep_init_as_ip=False). For all other
    export types keep initializers as input (val_keep_init_as_ip=True).
    If keep_initializers_as_inputs is specified, then respect it. Unless opset version <= 8,
    in which case it must be ignored because for opset version <= 8, all initializers MUST be
    part of graph input (only ONNX IR v3 is allowed), i.e. val_keep_init_as_ip=True.

    Special handling is needed for opset version 8 or lower, because irrespective
    of user input for keep_initializers_as_inputs, the graph must follow ONNX IR v3
    semantics, i.e. all initializers must be listed as ONNX graph input.
