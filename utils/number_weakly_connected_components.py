    """Returns the number of weakly connected components in G.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
        A directed graph.

    Returns
    -------
    n : integer
        Number of weakly connected components

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXNotImplemented
        If G is undirected.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.DiGraph([(0, 1), (2, 1), (3, 4)])
    >>> nx.number_weakly_connected_components(G)
    2
