    """
    Open a .npy file as a memory-mapped array.

    This may be used to read an existing file or create a new one.

    Parameters
    ----------
    filename : str or path-like
        The name of the file on disk.  This may *not* be a file-like
        object.
    mode : str, optional
        The mode in which to open the file; the default is 'r+'.  In
        addition to the standard file modes, 'c' is also accepted to mean
        "copy on write."  See `memmap` for the available mode strings.
    dtype : data-type, optional
        The data type of the array if we are creating a new file in "write"
        mode, if not, `dtype` is ignored.  The default value is None, which
        results in a data-type of `float64`.
    shape : tuple of int
        The shape of the array if we are creating a new file in "write"
        mode, in which case this parameter is required.  Otherwise, this
        parameter is ignored and is thus optional.
    fortran_order : bool, optional
        Whether the array should be Fortran-contiguous (True) or
        C-contiguous (False, the default) if we are creating a new file in
        "write" mode.
    version : tuple of int (major, minor) or None
        If the mode is a "write" mode, then this is the version of the file
        format used to create the file.  None means use the oldest
        supported version that is able to store the data.  Default: None
    max_header_size : int, optional
        Maximum allowed size of the header.  Large headers may not be safe
        to load securely and thus require explicitly passing a larger value.
        See :py:func:`ast.literal_eval()` for details.

    Returns
    -------
    marray : memmap
        The memory-mapped array.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the data or the mode is invalid.
    OSError
        If the file is not found or cannot be opened correctly.
