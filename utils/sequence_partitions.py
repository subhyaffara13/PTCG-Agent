def sequence_partitions(l, n, /):
    r"""Returns the partition of sequence $l$ into $n$ bins

    Explanation
    ===========

    Given the sequence $l_1 \cdots l_m \in V^+$ where
    $V^+$ is the Kleene plus of $V$

    The set of $n$ partitions of $l$ is defined as:

    .. math::
        \{(s_1, \cdots, s_n) | s_1 \in V^+, \cdots, s_n \in V^+,
        s_1 \cdots s_n = l_1 \cdots l_m\}

    Parameters
    ==========

    l : Sequence[T]
        A nonempty sequence of any Python objects

    n : int
        A positive integer

    Yields
    ======

    out : list[Sequence[T]]
        A list of sequences with concatenation equals $l$.
        This should conform with the type of $l$.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.utilities.iterables import sequence_partitions
    >>> for out in sequence_partitions([1, 2, 3, 4], 2):
    ...     print(out)
    [[1], [2, 3, 4]]
    [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
    [[1, 2, 3], [4]]
