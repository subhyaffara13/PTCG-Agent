    Retries on 408, 409, 429 and 500 errors.

    Any client error in the 400-499 range that isn't explicitly handled (such as 400 Bad Request, 401 Unauthorized, 403 Forbidden, 404 Not Found, etc.) would not trigger a retry.

    Reimplementation of openai's should retry logic, since that one can't be imported.
