def weightedtau(x, y, rank=True, weigher=None, additive=True):
    r"""Compute a weighted version of Kendall's :math:`\tau`.

    The weighted :math:`\tau` is a weighted version of Kendall's
    :math:`\tau` in which exchanges of high weight are more influential than
    exchanges of low weight. The default parameters compute the additive
    hyperbolic version of the index, :math:`\tau_\mathrm h`, which has
    been shown to provide the best balance between important and
    unimportant elements [1]_.

    The weighting is defined by means of a rank array, which assigns a
    nonnegative rank to each element (higher importance ranks being
    associated with smaller values, e.g., 0 is the highest possible rank),
    and a weigher function, which assigns a weight based on the rank to
    each element. The weight of an exchange is then the sum or the product
    of the weights of the ranks of the exchanged elements. The default
    parameters compute :math:`\tau_\mathrm h`: an exchange between
    elements with rank :math:`r` and :math:`s` (starting from zero) has
    weight :math:`1/(r+1) + 1/(s+1)`.

    Specifying a rank array is meaningful only if you have in mind an
    external criterion of importance. If, as it usually happens, you do
    not have in mind a specific rank, the weighted :math:`\tau` is
    defined by averaging the values obtained using the decreasing
    lexicographical rank by (`x`, `y`) and by (`y`, `x`). This is the
    behavior with default parameters. Note that the convention used
    here for ranking (lower values imply higher importance) is opposite
    to that used by other SciPy statistical functions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y : array_like
        Arrays of scores, of the same shape. If arrays are not 1-D, they will
        be flattened to 1-D.
    rank : array_like of ints or bool, optional
        A nonnegative rank assigned to each element. If it is None, the
        decreasing lexicographical rank by (`x`, `y`) will be used: elements of
        higher rank will be those with larger `x`-values, using `y`-values to
        break ties (in particular, swapping `x` and `y` will give a different
        result). If it is False, the element indices will be used
        directly as ranks. The default is True, in which case this
        function returns the average of the values obtained using the
        decreasing lexicographical rank by (`x`, `y`) and by (`y`, `x`).
    weigher : callable, optional
        The weigher function. Must map nonnegative integers (zero
        representing the most important element) to a nonnegative weight.
        The default, None, provides hyperbolic weighing, that is,
        rank :math:`r` is mapped to weight :math:`1/(r+1)`.
    additive : bool, optional
        If True, the weight of an exchange is computed by adding the
        weights of the ranks of the exchanged elements; otherwise, the weights
        are multiplied. The default is True.

    Returns
    -------
    res: SignificanceResult
        An object containing attributes:

        statistic : float
           The weighted :math:`\tau` correlation index.
        pvalue : float
           Presently ``np.nan``, as the null distribution of the statistic is
           unknown (even in the additive hyperbolic case).

    Notes
    -----
    This function uses an :math:`O(n \log n)`, mergesort-based algorithm
    [1]_ that is a weighted extension of Knight's algorithm for Kendall's
    :math:`\tau` [2]_. It can compute Shieh's weighted :math:`\tau` [3]_
    between rankings without ties (i.e., permutations) by setting
    `additive` and `rank` to False, as the definition given in [1]_ is a
    generalization of Shieh's.

    NaNs are considered the smallest possible score.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from scipy import stats
    >>> x = [12, 2, 1, 12, 2]
    >>> y = [1, 4, 7, 1, 0]
    >>> res = stats.weightedtau(x, y)
    >>> res.statistic
    -0.56694968153682723
    >>> res.pvalue
    nan
    >>> res = stats.weightedtau(x, y, additive=False)
    >>> res.statistic
    -0.62205716951801038

    NaNs are considered the smallest possible score:

    >>> x = [12, 2, 1, 12, 2]
    >>> y = [1, 4, 7, 1, np.nan]
    >>> res = stats.weightedtau(x, y)
    >>> res.statistic
    -0.56694968153682723

    This is exactly Kendall's tau:

    >>> x = [12, 2, 1, 12, 2]
    >>> y = [1, 4, 7, 1, 0]
    >>> res = stats.weightedtau(x, y, weigher=lambda x: 1)
    >>> res.statistic
    -0.47140452079103173

    >>> x = [12, 2, 1, 12, 2]
    >>> y = [1, 4, 7, 1, 0]
    >>> stats.weightedtau(x, y, rank=None)
    SignificanceResult(statistic=-0.4157652301037516, pvalue=nan)
    >>> stats.weightedtau(y, x, rank=None)
