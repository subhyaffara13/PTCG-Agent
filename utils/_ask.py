    """
    Find the truth value for a property of an object.

    This function is called when a request is made to see what a fact
    value is.

    For this we use several techniques:

    First, the fact-evaluation function is tried, if it exists (for
    example _eval_is_integer). Then we try related facts. For example

        rational   -->   integer

    another example is joined rule:

        integer & !odd  --> even

    so in the latter case if we are looking at what 'even' value is,
    'integer' and 'odd' facts will be asked.

    In all cases, when we settle on some fact value, its implications are
    deduced, and the result is cached in ._assumptions.
