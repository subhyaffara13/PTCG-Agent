def projected_graph(B, nodes, multigraph=False):
    r"""Returns the projection of B onto one of its node sets.

    Returns the graph G that is the projection of the bipartite graph B
    onto the specified nodes. They retain their attributes and are connected
    in G if they have a common neighbor in B.

    Parameters
    ----------
    B : NetworkX graph
      The input graph should be bipartite.

    nodes : list or iterable
      Nodes to project onto (the "bottom" nodes).

    multigraph: bool (default=False)
       If True return a multigraph where the multiple edges represent multiple
       shared neighbors.  They edge key in the multigraph is assigned to the
       label of the neighbor.

    Returns
    -------
    Graph : NetworkX graph or multigraph
       A graph that is the projection onto the given nodes.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from networkx.algorithms import bipartite
    >>> B = nx.path_graph(4)
    >>> G = bipartite.projected_graph(B, [1, 3])
    >>> list(G)
    [1, 3]
    >>> list(G.edges())
    [(1, 3)]

    If nodes `a`, and `b` are connected through both nodes 1 and 2 then
    building a multigraph results in two edges in the projection onto
    [`a`, `b`]:

    >>> B = nx.Graph()
    >>> B.add_edges_from([("a", 1), ("b", 1), ("a", 2), ("b", 2)])
    >>> G = bipartite.projected_graph(B, ["a", "b"], multigraph=True)
    >>> print([sorted((u, v)) for u, v in G.edges()])
    [['a', 'b'], ['a', 'b']]

    Notes
    -----
    No attempt is made to verify that the input graph B is bipartite.
    Returns a simple graph that is the projection of the bipartite graph B
    onto the set of nodes given in list nodes.  If multigraph=True then
    a multigraph is returned with an edge for every shared neighbor.

    Directed graphs are allowed as input.  The output will also then
    be a directed graph with edges if there is a directed path between
    the nodes.

    The graph and node properties are (shallow) copied to the projected graph.

    See :mod:`bipartite documentation <networkx.algorithms.bipartite>`
    for further details on how bipartite graphs are handled in NetworkX.
