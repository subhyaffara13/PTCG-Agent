def paley_graph(p, create_using=None):
    r"""Returns the Paley $\frac{(p-1)}{2}$ -regular graph on $p$ nodes.

    The returned graph is a graph on $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ with edges between $x$ and $y$
    if and only if $x-y$ is a nonzero square in $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$.

    If $p \equiv 1  \pmod 4$, $-1$ is a square in
    $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ and therefore $x-y$ is a square if and
    only if $y-x$ is also a square, i.e the edges in the Paley graph are symmetric.

    If $p \equiv 3 \pmod 4$, $-1$ is not a square in $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$
    and therefore either $x-y$ or $y-x$ is a square in $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$ but not both.

    Note that a more general definition of Paley graphs extends this construction
    to graphs over $q=p^n$ vertices, by using the finite field $F_q$ instead of
    $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$.
    This construction requires to compute squares in general finite fields and is
    not what is implemented here (i.e `paley_graph(25)` does not return the true
    Paley graph associated with $5^2$).

    Parameters
    ----------
    p : int, an odd prime number.

    create_using : NetworkX graph constructor, optional (default=nx.Graph)
       Graph type to create. If graph instance, then cleared before populated.

    Returns
    -------
    G : graph
        The constructed directed graph.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        If the graph is a multigraph.
