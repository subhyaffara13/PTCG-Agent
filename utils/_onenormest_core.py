def _onenormest_core(A, AT, t, itmax):
    """
    Compute a lower bound of the 1-norm of a sparse array.

    Parameters
    ----------
    A : ndarray or other linear operator
        A linear operator that can produce matrix products.
    AT : ndarray or other linear operator
        The transpose of A.
    t : int, optional
        A positive parameter controlling the tradeoff between
        accuracy versus time and memory usage.
    itmax : int, optional
        Use at most this many iterations.

    Returns
    -------
    est : float
        An underestimate of the 1-norm of the sparse array.
    v : ndarray, optional
        The vector such that ||Av||_1 == est*||v||_1.
        It can be thought of as an input to the linear operator
        that gives an output with particularly large norm.
    w : ndarray, optional
        The vector Av which has relatively large 1-norm.
        It can be thought of as an output of the linear operator
        that is relatively large in norm compared to the input.
    nmults : int, optional
        The number of matrix products that were computed.
    nresamples : int, optional
        The number of times a parallel column was observed,
        necessitating a re-randomization of the column.

    Notes
    -----
    This is algorithm 2.4.
