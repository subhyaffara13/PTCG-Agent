    Compute a weak normal form of ``f`` with respect to ``G`` and order ``O``.

    The ground field is assumed to be ``K``, and monomials ordered according to
    ``O``.

    This is the standard Buchberger algorithm for computing weak normal forms with
    respect to *global* monomial orders [SCA, algorithm 1.6.10].

    If ``phantom`` is not ``None``, it should be a pair of "phantom" arguments
    on which to perform the same computations as on ``f``, ``G``, both results
    are then returned.
