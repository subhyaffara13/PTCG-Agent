    r"""Creates a directed graph D from an undirected graph G to compute flow
    based node connectivity.

    For an undirected graph G having `n` nodes and `m` edges we derive a
    directed graph D with `2n` nodes and `2m+n` arcs by replacing each
    original node `v` with two nodes `vA`, `vB` linked by an (internal)
    arc in D. Then for each edge (`u`, `v`) in G we add two arcs (`uB`, `vA`)
    and (`vB`, `uA`) in D. Finally we set the attribute capacity = 1 for each
    arc in D [1]_.

    arc (`uB`, `vA`) in D. Finally we set the attribute capacity = 1 for
    each arc in D.

    A dictionary with a mapping between nodes in the original graph and the
    auxiliary digraph is stored as a graph attribute: D.graph['mapping'].
