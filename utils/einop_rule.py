    Propagate the sharding of inputs to output for ops whose data moves according to einsum notation.

    This is mostly borrowed from @zdevito's sharding simulator. Examples:
        mk,kn->mn - einsum
        ij,ij->ij - addition
        ij,j->ij - broadcasted addition
        ij->i - reduction
    Other ops could use this propagation algorithm when applied, note
    that einsum propagation only deal with list of specs (DTensor specs)
    as it only works on list of tensors!

    linearity in einop_rule means that the calling op `f` follows this rule:
        f(a + b) = f(a) + f(b)

    In this case we can propagate the partial sum, note that linearity in einop
    only applies to partial sum, not other operations like min/max (which are
    associative but not linear).
