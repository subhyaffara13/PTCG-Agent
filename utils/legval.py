def legval(x, c, tensor=True):
    """
    Evaluate a Legendre series at points x.

    If `c` is of length ``n + 1``, this function returns the value:

    .. math:: p(x) = c_0 * L_0(x) + c_1 * L_1(x) + ... + c_n * L_n(x)

    The parameter `x` is converted to an array only if it is a tuple or a
    list, otherwise it is treated as a scalar. In either case, either `x`
    or its elements must support multiplication and addition both with
    themselves and with the elements of `c`.

    If `c` is a 1-D array, then ``p(x)`` will have the same shape as `x`.  If
    `c` is multidimensional, then the shape of the result depends on the
    value of `tensor`. If `tensor` is true the shape will be c.shape[1:] +
    x.shape. If `tensor` is false the shape will be c.shape[1:]. Note that
    scalars have shape (,).

    Trailing zeros in the coefficients will be used in the evaluation, so
    they should be avoided if efficiency is a concern.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like, compatible object
        If `x` is a list or tuple, it is converted to an ndarray, otherwise
        it is left unchanged and treated as a scalar. In either case, `x`
        or its elements must support addition and multiplication with
        themselves and with the elements of `c`.
    c : array_like
        Array of coefficients ordered so that the coefficients for terms of
        degree n are contained in c[n]. If `c` is multidimensional the
        remaining indices enumerate multiple polynomials. In the two
        dimensional case the coefficients may be thought of as stored in
        the columns of `c`.
    tensor : boolean, optional
        If True, the shape of the coefficient array is extended with ones
        on the right, one for each dimension of `x`. Scalars have dimension 0
        for this action. The result is that every column of coefficients in
        `c` is evaluated for every element of `x`. If False, `x` is broadcast
        over the columns of `c` for the evaluation.  This keyword is useful
        when `c` is multidimensional. The default value is True.

    Returns
    -------
    values : ndarray, algebra_like
        The shape of the return value is described above.

    Notes
    -----
    The evaluation uses Clenshaw recursion, aka synthetic division.
