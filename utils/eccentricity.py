def eccentricity(G, v=None, sp=None, weight=None):
    """Returns the eccentricity of nodes in G.

    The eccentricity of a node v is the maximum distance from v to
    all other nodes in G.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
       A graph

    v : node, optional
       Return value of specified node

    sp : dict of dicts, optional
       All pairs shortest path lengths as a dictionary of dictionaries

    weight : string, function, or None (default=None)
        If this is a string, then edge weights will be accessed via the
        edge attribute with this key (that is, the weight of the edge
        joining `u` to `v` will be ``G.edges[u, v][weight]``). If no
        such edge attribute exists, the weight of the edge is assumed to
        be one.

        If this is a function, the weight of an edge is the value
        returned by the function. The function must accept exactly three
        positional arguments: the two endpoints of an edge and the
        dictionary of edge attributes for that edge. The function must
        return a number.

        If this is None, every edge has weight/distance/cost 1.

        Weights stored as floating point values can lead to small round-off
        errors in distances. Use integer weights to avoid this.

        Weights should be positive, since they are distances.

    Returns
    -------
    ecc : dictionary
       A dictionary of eccentricity values keyed by node.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.Graph([(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)])
    >>> dict(nx.eccentricity(G))
    {1: 2, 2: 3, 3: 2, 4: 2, 5: 3}

    >>> dict(
    ...     nx.eccentricity(G, v=[1, 5])
    ... )  # This returns the eccentricity of node 1 & 5
    {1: 2, 5: 3}
