def is_reachable(G, s, t):
    """Decides whether there is a path from `s` to `t` in the
    tournament.

    This function is more theoretically efficient than the reachability
    checks than the shortest path algorithms in
    :mod:`networkx.algorithms.shortest_paths`.

    The given graph **must** be a tournament, otherwise this function's
    behavior is undefined.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
        A directed graph representing a tournament.

    s : node
        A node in the graph.

    t : node
        A node in the graph.

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        Whether there is a path from `s` to `t` in `G`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.DiGraph([(1, 0), (1, 3), (1, 2), (2, 3), (2, 0), (3, 0)])
    >>> nx.is_tournament(G)
    True
    >>> nx.tournament.is_reachable(G, 1, 3)
    True
    >>> nx.tournament.is_reachable(G, 3, 2)
    False

    Notes
    -----
    Although this function is more theoretically efficient than the
    generic shortest path functions, a speedup requires the use of
    parallelism. Though it may in the future, the current implementation
    does not use parallelism, thus you may not see much of a speedup.

    This algorithm comes from [1].
