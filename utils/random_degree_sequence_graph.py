def random_degree_sequence_graph(sequence, seed=None, tries=10):
    r"""Returns a simple random graph with the given degree sequence.

    If the maximum degree $d_m$ in the sequence is $O(m^{1/4})$ then the
    algorithm produces almost uniform random graphs in $O(m d_m)$ time
    where $m$ is the number of edges.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sequence :  list of integers
        Sequence of degrees
    seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
        Indicator of random number generation state.
        See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.
    tries : int, optional
        Maximum number of tries to create a graph

    Returns
    -------
    G : Graph
        A graph with the specified degree sequence.
        Nodes are labeled starting at 0 with an index
        corresponding to the position in the sequence.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXUnfeasible
        If the degree sequence is not graphical.
    NetworkXError
        If a graph is not produced in specified number of tries

    Notes
    -----
    The generator algorithm [1]_ is not guaranteed to produce a graph.
