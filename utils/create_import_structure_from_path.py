    """
    This method takes the path to a file/a folder and returns the import structure.
    If a file is given, it will return the import structure of the parent folder.

    Import structures are designed to be digestible by `_LazyModule` objects. They are
    created from the __all__ definitions in each files as well as the `@require` decorators
    above methods and objects.

    The import structure allows explicit display of the required backends for a given object.
    These backends are specified in two ways:

    1. Through their `@require`, if they are exported with that decorator. This `@require` decorator
       accepts a `backend` tuple kwarg mentioning which backends are required to run this object.

    2. If an object is defined in a file with "default" backends, it will have, at a minimum, this
       backend specified. The default backends are defined according to the filename:

       - If a file is named like `modeling_*.py`, it will have a `torch` backend
       - If a file is named like `tokenization_*_fast.py`, it will have a `tokenizers` backend
       - If a file is named like `image_processing*_fast.py`, it will have a `torchvision` + `torch` backend

    Backends serve the purpose of displaying a clear error message to the user in case the backends are not installed.
    Should an object be imported without its required backends being in the environment, any attempt to use the
    object will raise an error mentioning which backend(s) should be added to the environment in order to use
    that object.

    Here's an example of an input import structure at the src.transformers.models level:

    {
        'albert': {
            frozenset(): {
                'configuration_albert': {'AlbertConfig'}
            },
            frozenset({'tokenizers'}): {
                'tokenization_albert_fast': {'AlbertTokenizer'}
            },
        },
        'align': {
            frozenset(): {
                'configuration_align': {'AlignConfig', 'AlignTextConfig', 'AlignVisionConfig'},
                'processing_align': {'AlignProcessor'}
            },
        },
        'altclip': {
            frozenset(): {
                'configuration_altclip': {'AltCLIPConfig', 'AltCLIPTextConfig', 'AltCLIPVisionConfig'},
