    reference pixels into a 3d array

    Create a new 3D array that directly references the pixel values in a
    Surface. Any changes to the array will affect the pixels in the
    Surface. This is a fast operation since no data is copied.

    This will only work on Surfaces that have 24-bit or 32-bit
    formats. Lower pixel formats cannot be referenced.

    The Surface this references will remain locked for the lifetime of
    the array (see the Surface.lock - lock the Surface memory for pixel
    access method).
