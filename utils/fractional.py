def fractional(value: NumberOrString) -> str:
    """Convert to fractional number.

    There will be some cases where one might not want to show ugly decimal places for
    floats and decimals.

    This function returns a human-readable fractional number in form of fractions and
    mixed fractions.

    Pass in a string, or a number or a float, and this function returns:

    * a string representation of a fraction
    * or a whole number
    * or a mixed fraction
    * or the str output of the value, if it could not be converted

    Examples:
        ```pycon
        >>> fractional(0.3)
        '3/10'
        >>> fractional(1.3)
        '1 3/10'
        >>> fractional(float(1/3))
        '1/3'
        >>> fractional(1)
        '1'
        >>> fractional("ten")
        'ten'
        >>> fractional(None)
        'None'

        ```

    Args:
        value (int, float, str): Integer to convert.

    Returns:
        str: Fractional number as a string.
