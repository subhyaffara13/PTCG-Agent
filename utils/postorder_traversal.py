def postorder_traversal(node, keys=None):
    """
    Do a postorder traversal of a tree.

    This generator recursively yields nodes that it has visited in a postorder
    fashion. That is, it descends through the tree depth-first to yield all of
    a node's children's postorder traversal before yielding the node itself.

    Parameters
    ==========

    node : SymPy expression
        The expression to traverse.
    keys : (default None) sort key(s)
        The key(s) used to sort args of Basic objects. When None, args of Basic
        objects are processed in arbitrary order. If key is defined, it will
        be passed along to ordered() as the only key(s) to use to sort the
        arguments; if ``key`` is simply True then the default keys of
        ``ordered`` will be used (node count and default_sort_key).

    Yields
    ======
    subtree : SymPy expression
        All of the subtrees in the tree.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import postorder_traversal
    >>> from sympy.abc import w, x, y, z

    The nodes are returned in the order that they are encountered unless key
    is given; simply passing key=True will guarantee that the traversal is
    unique.

    >>> list(postorder_traversal(w + (x + y)*z)) # doctest: +SKIP
    [z, y, x, x + y, z*(x + y), w, w + z*(x + y)]
    >>> list(postorder_traversal(w + (x + y)*z, keys=True))
    [w, z, x, y, x + y, z*(x + y), w + z*(x + y)]
