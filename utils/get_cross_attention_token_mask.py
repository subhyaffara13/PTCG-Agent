def get_cross_attention_token_mask(input_ids: list[int], image_token_id: int) -> list[list[int]]:
    """
    Generate a cross-attention token mask for image tokens in the input sequence.

    This function identifies the positions of image tokens in the input sequence and creates
    a mask that defines which subsequent tokens each image token should attend to.

    Args:
        input_ids (list[int]): A list of token ids representing the input sequence.
        image_token_id (int): The id of the token used to represent images in the sequence.

    Returns:
        list[list[int]]: A list of [start, end] pairs, where each pair represents the range
        of tokens an image token should attend to.

    Notes:
        - If no image tokens are present, an empty list is returned.
        - For a single image token, it attends to all subsequent tokens until the end of the sequence.
        - For multiple image tokens, each attends to tokens up to the next image token or the end of the sequence.
        - Consecutive image tokens are treated as a group and attend to all subsequent tokens together.
