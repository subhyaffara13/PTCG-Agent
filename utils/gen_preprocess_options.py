    two types of compilers: the typical Unix compiler and Visual C++.
    'macros' is the usual thing, a list of 1- or 2-tuples, where (name,)
    means undefine (-U) macro 'name', and (name,value) means define (-D)
    macro 'name' to 'value'.  'include_dirs' is just a list of directory
    names to be added to the header file search path (-I).  Returns a list
    of command-line options suitable for either Unix compilers or Visual
    C++.

    # XXX it would be nice (mainly aesthetic, and so we don't generate
    # stupid-looking command lines) to go over 'macros' and eliminate
    # redundant definitions/undefinitions (ie. ensure that only the
    # latest mention of a particular macro winds up on the command
    # line).  I don't think it's essential, though, since most (all?)
    # Unix C compilers only pay attention to the latest -D or -U
    # mention of a macro on their command line.  Similar situation for
    # 'include_dirs'.  I'm punting on both for now.  Anyways, weeding out
    # redundancies like this should probably be the province of
    # CCompiler, since the data structures used are inherited from it
    # and therefore common to all CCompiler classes.
