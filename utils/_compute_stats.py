  """Computes mean and variance statistics.

  This implementation takes care of a few important details:
  - By default, computes in float32 precision for stability
    in half precision training.
  - If `use_fast_variance` is `True`, mean and variance are computed using
    Var = E[|x|^2] - |E[x]|^2, instead of Var = E[|x - E[x]|^2]), in a single
    XLA fusion.
  - Clips negative variances to zero which can happen due to
    roundoff errors. This avoids downstream NaNs.
  - Supports averaging across a parallel axis and subgroups of a parallel axis
    with a single `lax.pmean` call to avoid latency.

  Arguments:
    x: Input array.
    axes: The axes in ``x`` to compute mean and variance statistics for.
    dtype: Optional dtype specifying the minimal precision. Statistics are
      always at least float32 for stability (default: dtype of x).
    axis_name: Optional name for the pmapped axis to compute mean over. Note,
      this is only used for pmap and shard map. For SPMD jit, you do not need to
      manually synchronize. Just make sure that the axes are correctly annotated
      and XLA:SPMD will insert the necessary collectives.
    axis_index_groups: Optional groups of indices within that named axis.
    use_mean: If true, calculate the mean from the input and use it when
      computing the variance. If false, set the mean to zero and compute the
      variance without subtracting the mean.
    use_fast_variance: If true, use a faster, but less numerically stable,
      calculation for the variance.
    mask: Binary array of shape broadcastable to `inputs` tensor, indicating the
      positions for which the mean and variance should be computed.
    force_float32_reductions: If false, this will skip float32 promotion and use
      the input dtype or inherited dtype from ``x``.

  Returns:
    A pair ``(mean, var)``.
