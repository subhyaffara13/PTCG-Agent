def greedy_branching(G, attr="weight", default=1, kind="max", seed=None):
    """
    Returns a branching obtained through a greedy algorithm.

    This algorithm is wrong, and cannot give a proper optimal branching.
    However, we include it for pedagogical reasons, as it can be helpful to
    see what its outputs are.

    The output is a branching, and possibly, a spanning arborescence. However,
    it is not guaranteed to be optimal in either case.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : DiGraph
        The directed graph to scan.
    attr : str
        The attribute to use as weights. If None, then each edge will be
        treated equally with a weight of 1.
    default : float
        When `attr` is not None, then if an edge does not have that attribute,
        `default` specifies what value it should take.
    kind : str
        The type of optimum to search for: 'min' or 'max' greedy branching.
    seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
        Indicator of random number generation state.
        See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.

    Returns
    -------
    B : directed graph
        The greedily obtained branching.
