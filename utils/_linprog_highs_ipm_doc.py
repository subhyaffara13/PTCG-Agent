    Linear programming: minimize a linear objective function subject to linear
    equality and inequality constraints using the HiGHS interior point solver.

    Linear programming solves problems of the following form:

    .. math::

        \min_x \ & c^T x \\
        \mbox{such that} \ & A_{ub} x \leq b_{ub},\\
        & A_{eq} x = b_{eq},\\
        & l \leq x \leq u ,

    where :math:`x` is a vector of decision variables; :math:`c`,
    :math:`b_{ub}`, :math:`b_{eq}`, :math:`l`, and :math:`u` are vectors; and
    :math:`A_{ub}` and :math:`A_{eq}` are matrices.

    Alternatively, that's:

    minimize::

        c @ x

    such that::

        A_ub @ x <= b_ub
        A_eq @ x == b_eq
        lb <= x <= ub

    Note that by default ``lb = 0`` and ``ub = None`` unless specified with
    ``bounds``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c : 1-D array
        The coefficients of the linear objective function to be minimized.
    A_ub : 2-D array, optional
        The inequality constraint matrix. Each row of ``A_ub`` specifies the
        coefficients of a linear inequality constraint on ``x``.
    b_ub : 1-D array, optional
        The inequality constraint vector. Each element represents an
        upper bound on the corresponding value of ``A_ub @ x``.
    A_eq : 2-D array, optional
        The equality constraint matrix. Each row of ``A_eq`` specifies the
        coefficients of a linear equality constraint on ``x``.
    b_eq : 1-D array, optional
        The equality constraint vector. Each element of ``A_eq @ x`` must equal
        the corresponding element of ``b_eq``.
    bounds : sequence, optional
        A sequence of ``(min, max)`` pairs for each element in ``x``, defining
        the minimum and maximum values of that decision variable. Use ``None``
        to indicate that there is no bound. By default, bounds are
        ``(0, None)`` (all decision variables are non-negative).
        If a single tuple ``(min, max)`` is provided, then ``min`` and
        ``max`` will serve as bounds for all decision variables.
    method : str

        This is the method-specific documentation for 'highs-ipm'.
        :ref:`'highs-ipm' <optimize.linprog-highs>`,
        :ref:`'highs-ds' <optimize.linprog-highs-ds>`,
        :ref:`'interior-point' <optimize.linprog-interior-point>` (default),
        :ref:`'revised simplex' <optimize.linprog-revised_simplex>`, and
        :ref:`'simplex' <optimize.linprog-simplex>` (legacy)
        are also available.

    Options
    -------
    maxiter : int
        The maximum number of iterations to perform in either phase.
        For :ref:`'highs-ipm' <optimize.linprog-highs-ipm>`, this does not
        include the number of crossover iterations. Default is the largest
        possible value for an ``int`` on the platform.
    disp : bool (default: ``False``)
        Set to ``True`` if indicators of optimization status are to be
        printed to the console during optimization.
    presolve : bool (default: ``True``)
        Presolve attempts to identify trivial infeasibilities,
        identify trivial unboundedness, and simplify the problem before
        sending it to the main solver. It is generally recommended
        to keep the default setting ``True``; set to ``False`` if
        presolve is to be disabled.
    time_limit : float
        The maximum time in seconds allotted to solve the problem;
        default is the largest possible value for a ``double`` on the
        platform.
    dual_feasibility_tolerance : double (default: 1e-07)
        The minimum of this and ``primal_feasibility_tolerance``
        is used for the feasibility tolerance of
        :ref:`'highs-ipm' <optimize.linprog-highs-ipm>`.
    primal_feasibility_tolerance : double (default: 1e-07)
        The minimum of this and ``dual_feasibility_tolerance``
        is used for the feasibility tolerance of
        :ref:`'highs-ipm' <optimize.linprog-highs-ipm>`.
    ipm_optimality_tolerance : double (default: ``1e-08``)
        Optimality tolerance for
        :ref:`'highs-ipm' <optimize.linprog-highs-ipm>`.
        Minimum allowable value is 1e-12.
    unknown_options : dict
        Optional arguments not used by this particular solver. If
        ``unknown_options`` is non-empty, a warning is issued listing
        all unused options.

    Notes
    -----

    Method :ref:`'highs-ipm' <optimize.linprog-highs-ipm>`
    is a wrapper of a C++ implementation of an **i**\ nterior-\ **p**\ oint
    **m**\ ethod [13]_; it features a crossover routine, so it is as accurate
    as a simplex solver.
    Method :ref:`'highs-ds' <optimize.linprog-highs-ds>` is a wrapper
    of the C++ high performance dual revised simplex implementation (HSOL)
    [13]_, [14]_. Method :ref:`'highs' <optimize.linprog-highs>` chooses
    between the two automatically. For new code involving `linprog`, we
    recommend explicitly choosing one of these three method values instead of
    :ref:`'interior-point' <optimize.linprog-interior-point>` (default),
    :ref:`'revised simplex' <optimize.linprog-revised_simplex>`, and
    :ref:`'simplex' <optimize.linprog-simplex>` (legacy).

    The result fields `ineqlin`, `eqlin`, `lower`, and `upper` all contain
    `marginals`, or partial derivatives of the objective function with respect
    to the right-hand side of each constraint. These partial derivatives are
    also referred to as "Lagrange multipliers", "dual values", and
    "shadow prices". The sign convention of `marginals` is opposite that
    of Lagrange multipliers produced by many nonlinear solvers.
