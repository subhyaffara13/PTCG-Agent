def schultz_index(G, weight=None):
    r"""Returns the Schultz Index (of the first kind) of `G`

    The *Schultz Index* [3]_ of a graph is the sum over all node pairs of
    distances times the sum of degrees. Consider an undirected graph `G`.
    For each node pair ``(u, v)`` compute ``dist(u, v) * (deg(u) + deg(v)``
    where ``dist`` is the shortest path length between two nodes and ``deg``
    is the degree of a node.

    The Schultz Index is the sum of these quantities over all (unordered)
    pairs of nodes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
        The undirected graph of interest.
    weight : string or None, optional (default: None)
        If None, every edge has weight 1.
        If a string, use this edge attribute as the edge weight.
        Any edge attribute not present defaults to 1.
        The edge weights are used to computing shortest-path distances.

    Returns
    -------
    number
        The first kind of Schultz Index of the graph `G`.

    Examples
    --------
    The Schultz Index of the (unweighted) complete graph on *n* nodes
    equals the number of pairs of the *n* nodes times ``2 * (n - 1)``,
    since each pair of nodes is at distance one and the sum of degree
    of two nodes is ``2 * (n - 1)``.

    >>> n = 10
    >>> G = nx.complete_graph(n)
    >>> nx.schultz_index(G) == (n * (n - 1) / 2) * (2 * (n - 1))
    True

    Graph that is disconnected

    >>> nx.schultz_index(nx.empty_graph(2))
    inf
