def single_source_bellman_ford_path(G, source, weight="weight"):
    """Compute shortest path between source and all other reachable
    nodes for a weighted graph.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    source : node
        Starting node for path.

    weight : string or function (default="weight")
        If this is a string, then edge weights will be accessed via the
        edge attribute with this key (that is, the weight of the edge
        joining `u` to `v` will be ``G.edges[u, v][weight]``). If no
        such edge attribute exists, the weight of the edge is assumed to
        be one.

        If this is a function, the weight of an edge is the value
        returned by the function. The function must accept exactly three
        positional arguments: the two endpoints of an edge and the
        dictionary of edge attributes for that edge. The function must
        return a number.

    Returns
    -------
    paths : dictionary
        Dictionary of shortest path lengths keyed by target.

    Raises
    ------
    NodeNotFound
        If `source` is not in `G`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.path_graph(5)
    >>> path = nx.single_source_bellman_ford_path(G, 0)
    >>> path[4]
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

    Notes
    -----
    Edge weight attributes must be numerical.
    Distances are calculated as sums of weighted edges traversed.
