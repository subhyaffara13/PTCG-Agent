    """
    Suppose you have a full tensor with size global_shape, and you have sharded
    it according to placements for mesh_shape.  This function returns, for a
    specific coordinate my_coordinate in the device mesh:

        - The size of your local shard WITHOUT padding (i.e., if you have
          an uneven split, your size might be smaller than the other entries
          in your dim), and

        - Where the data for your shard begins, in the full tensor.

    This function is fairly simple if your tensor is evenly sharded; the complication
    is around uneven splits.  There is also some complication for handling StridedShard,
    which changes the order you should apply sharding.

    Args:
        global_shape (ShapeType): The global shape of the tensor.
        mesh_shape (ShapeType): The shape of the device mesh.
        my_coordinate (Optional[list[int]]): The coordinate of the current rank in the device mesh.
        placements (Sequence[Placement]): The placements of the DTensor.
        skip_offset (bool): If True, skip computing the global offsets and return an empty
            tuple for global_offset. This can improve performance when only the local shape
            is needed. Defaults to False.

    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing:
            - local_shape (tuple[int, ...]): The shape of the local shard on the current rank.
            - global_offset (tuple[int, ...]): The offsets for each dimension identifying where
              this shard begins in the global tensor. If skip_offset is True, this will be an
              empty tuple.
