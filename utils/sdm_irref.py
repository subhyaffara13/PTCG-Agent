def sdm_irref(A):
    """RREF and pivots of a sparse matrix *A*.

    Compute the reduced row echelon form (RREF) of the matrix *A* and return a
    list of the pivot columns. This routine does not work in place and leaves
    the original matrix *A* unmodified.

    The domain of the matrix must be a field.

    Examples
    ========

    This routine works with a dict of dicts sparse representation of a matrix:

    >>> from sympy import QQ
    >>> from sympy.polys.matrices.sdm import sdm_irref
    >>> A = {0: {0: QQ(1), 1: QQ(2)}, 1: {0: QQ(3), 1: QQ(4)}}
    >>> Arref, pivots, _ = sdm_irref(A)
    >>> Arref
    {0: {0: 1}, 1: {1: 1}}
    >>> pivots
    [0, 1]

    The analogous calculation with :py:class:`~.MutableDenseMatrix` would be

    >>> from sympy import Matrix
    >>> M = Matrix([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
    >>> Mrref, pivots = M.rref()
    >>> Mrref
    Matrix([
    [1, 0],
    [0, 1]])
    >>> pivots
    (0, 1)

    Notes
    =====

    The cost of this algorithm is determined purely by the nonzero elements of
    the matrix. No part of the cost of any step in this algorithm depends on
    the number of rows or columns in the matrix. No step depends even on the
    number of nonzero rows apart from the primary loop over those rows. The
    implementation is much faster than ddm_rref for sparse matrices. In fact
    at the time of writing it is also (slightly) faster than the dense
    implementation even if the input is a fully dense matrix so it seems to be
    faster in all cases.

    The elements of the matrix should support exact division with ``/``. For
    example elements of any domain that is a field (e.g. ``QQ``) should be
    fine. No attempt is made to handle inexact arithmetic.

    #
    # Any zeros in the matrix are not stored at all so an element is zero if
    # its row dict has no index at that key. A row is entirely zero if its
    # row index is not in the outer dict. Since rref reorders the rows and
    # removes zero rows we can completely discard the row indices. The first
    # step then copies the row dicts into a list sorted by the index of the
    # first nonzero column in each row.
    #
    # The algorithm then processes each row Ai one at a time. Previously seen
    # rows are used to cancel their pivot columns from Ai. Then a pivot from
    # Ai is chosen and is cancelled from all previously seen rows. At this
    # point Ai joins the previously seen rows. Once all rows are seen all
    # elimination has occurred and the rows are sorted by pivot column index.
    #
    # The previously seen rows are stored in two separate groups. The reduced
    # group consists of all rows that have been reduced to a single nonzero
    # element (the pivot). There is no need to attempt any further reduction
    # with these. Rows that still have other nonzeros need to be considered
    # when Ai is cancelled from the previously seen rows.
    #
    # A dict nonzerocolumns is used to map from a column index to a set of
    # previously seen rows that still have a nonzero element in that column.
    # This means that we can cancel the pivot from Ai into the previously seen
    # rows without needing to loop over each row that might have a zero in
    # that column.
