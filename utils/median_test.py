def median_test(*samples, ties='below', correction=True, lambda_=1,
                nan_policy='propagate'):
    """Perform a Mood's median test.

    Test that two or more samples come from populations with the same median.

    Let ``n = len(samples)`` be the number of samples.  The "grand median" of
    all the data is computed, and a contingency table is formed by
    classifying the values in each sample as being above or below the grand
    median.  The contingency table, along with `correction` and `lambda_`,
    are passed to `scipy.stats.chi2_contingency` to compute the test statistic
    and p-value.

    Parameters
    ----------
    *samples : array_like
        The set of samples.  There must be at least two samples.
        Each sample must be a one-dimensional sequence containing at least
        one value.  The samples are not required to have the same length.
    ties : str, optional
        Determines how values equal to the grand median are classified in
        the contingency table.  The string must be one of::

            "below":
                Values equal to the grand median are counted as "below".
            "above":
                Values equal to the grand median are counted as "above".
            "ignore":
                Values equal to the grand median are not counted.

        The default is "below".
    correction : bool, optional
        If True, *and* there are just two samples, apply Yates' correction
        for continuity when computing the test statistic associated with
        the contingency table.  Default is True.
    lambda_ : float or str, optional
        By default, the statistic computed in this test is Pearson's
        chi-squared statistic.  `lambda_` allows a statistic from the
        Cressie-Read power divergence family to be used instead.  See
        `power_divergence` for details.
        Default is 1 (Pearson's chi-squared statistic).
    nan_policy : {'propagate', 'raise', 'omit'}, optional
        Defines how to handle when input contains nan. 'propagate' returns nan,
        'raise' throws an error, 'omit' performs the calculations ignoring nan
        values. Default is 'propagate'.

    Returns
    -------
    res : MedianTestResult
        An object containing attributes:

        statistic : float
            The test statistic.  The statistic that is returned is determined
            by `lambda_`.  The default is Pearson's chi-squared statistic.
        pvalue : float
            The p-value of the test.
        median : float
            The grand median.
        table : ndarray
            The contingency table.  The shape of the table is (2, n), where
            n is the number of samples.  The first row holds the counts of the
            values above the grand median, and the second row holds the counts
            of the values below the grand median.  The table allows further
            analysis with, for example, `scipy.stats.chi2_contingency`, or with
            `scipy.stats.fisher_exact` if there are two samples, without having
            to recompute the table.  If ``nan_policy`` is "propagate" and there
            are nans in the input, the return value for ``table`` is ``None``.

    Examples
    --------
    A biologist runs an experiment in which there are three groups of plants.
    Group 1 has 16 plants, group 2 has 15 plants, and group 3 has 17 plants.
    Each plant produces a number of seeds.  The seed counts for each group
    are::

        Group 1: 10 14 14 18 20 22 24 25 31 31 32 39 43 43 48 49
        Group 2: 28 30 31 33 34 35 36 40 44 55 57 61 91 92 99
        Group 3:  0  3  9 22 23 25 25 33 34 34 40 45 46 48 62 67 84

    The following code applies Mood's median test to these samples.

    >>> g1 = [10, 14, 14, 18, 20, 22, 24, 25, 31, 31, 32, 39, 43, 43, 48, 49]
    >>> g2 = [28, 30, 31, 33, 34, 35, 36, 40, 44, 55, 57, 61, 91, 92, 99]
    >>> g3 = [0, 3, 9, 22, 23, 25, 25, 33, 34, 34, 40, 45, 46, 48, 62, 67, 84]
    >>> from scipy.stats import median_test
    >>> res = median_test(g1, g2, g3)

    The median is

    >>> res.median
    34.0

    and the contingency table is

    >>> res.table
    array([[ 5, 10,  7],
           [11,  5, 10]])

    `p` is too large to conclude that the medians are not the same:

    >>> res.pvalue
    0.12609082774093244

    The "G-test" can be performed by passing ``lambda_="log-likelihood"`` to
    `median_test`.

    >>> res = median_test(g1, g2, g3, lambda_="log-likelihood")
    >>> res.pvalue
    0.12224779737117837

    The median occurs several times in the data, so we'll get a different
    result if, for example, ``ties="above"`` is used:

    >>> res = median_test(g1, g2, g3, ties="above")
    >>> res.pvalue
    0.063873276069553273

    >>> res.table
    array([[ 5, 11,  9],
           [11,  4,  8]])

    This example demonstrates that if the data set is not large and there
    are values equal to the median, the p-value can be sensitive to the
    choice of `ties`.
