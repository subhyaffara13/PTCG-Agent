def smart_open(filename_or_file, *args, **kwargs):
    '''
    This context manager allows you to open a filename, if you want to default
    some already-existing file object, like sys.stdout, which shouldn't be
    closed at the end of the context. If the filename argument is a str, bytes,
    or int, the file object is created via a call to open with the given *args
    and **kwargs, sent to the context, and closed at the end of the context,
    just like "with open(filename) as f:". If it isn't one of the openable
    types, the object simply sent to the context unchanged, and left unclosed
    at the end of the context. Example:

        def work_with_file(name=sys.stdout):
            with smart_open(name) as f:
                # Works correctly if name is a str filename or sys.stdout
                print("Some stuff", file=f)
                # If it was a filename, f is closed at the end here.
    '''
    if isinstance(filename_or_file, (str, bytes, int)):
        with open(filename_or_file, *args, **kwargs) as file:
            yield file
    else:
        yield filename_or_file
