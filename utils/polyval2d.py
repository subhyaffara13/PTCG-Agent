def polyval2d(x, y, c):
    """
    Evaluate a 2-D polynomial at points (x, y).

    This function returns the value

    .. math:: p(x,y) = \\sum_{i,j} c_{i,j} * x^i * y^j

    The parameters `x` and `y` are converted to arrays only if they are
    tuples or a lists, otherwise they are treated as a scalars and they
    must have the same shape after conversion. In either case, either `x`
    and `y` or their elements must support multiplication and addition both
    with themselves and with the elements of `c`.

    If `c` has fewer than two dimensions, ones are implicitly appended to
    its shape to make it 2-D. The shape of the result will be c.shape[2:] +
    x.shape.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y : array_like, compatible objects
        The two dimensional series is evaluated at the points ``(x, y)``,
        where `x` and `y` must have the same shape. If `x` or `y` is a list
        or tuple, it is first converted to an ndarray, otherwise it is left
        unchanged and, if it isn't an ndarray, it is treated as a scalar.
    c : array_like
        Array of coefficients ordered so that the coefficient of the term
        of multi-degree i,j is contained in ``c[i,j]``. If `c` has
        dimension greater than two the remaining indices enumerate multiple
        sets of coefficients.

    Returns
    -------
    values : ndarray, compatible object
        The values of the two dimensional polynomial at points formed with
        pairs of corresponding values from `x` and `y`.

    >>> P.polyval2d(1, 1, c)
