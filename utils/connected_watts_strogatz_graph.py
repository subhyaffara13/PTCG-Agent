def connected_watts_strogatz_graph(n, k, p, tries=100, seed=None, *, create_using=None):
    """Returns a connected Watts–Strogatz small-world graph.

    Attempts to generate a connected graph by repeated generation of
    Watts–Strogatz small-world graphs.  An exception is raised if the maximum
    number of tries is exceeded.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : int
        The number of nodes
    k : int
        Each node is joined with its `k` nearest neighbors in a ring
        topology.
    p : float
        The probability of rewiring each edge
    tries : int
        Number of attempts to generate a connected graph.
    seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
        Indicator of random number generation state.
        See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.
    create_using : Graph constructor, optional (default=nx.Graph)
        Graph type to create. If graph instance, then cleared before populated.
        Multigraph and directed types are not supported and raise a ``NetworkXError``.

    Notes
    -----
    First create a ring over $n$ nodes [1]_.  Then each node in the ring is joined
    to its $k$ nearest neighbors (or $k - 1$ neighbors if $k$ is odd).
    Then shortcuts are created by replacing some edges as follows: for each
    edge $(u, v)$ in the underlying "$n$-ring with $k$ nearest neighbors"
    with probability $p$ replace it with a new edge $(u, w)$ with uniformly
    random choice of existing node $w$.
    The entire process is repeated until a connected graph results.
