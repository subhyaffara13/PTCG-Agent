    Add a 'MATH' table to 'ttFont'.

    'constants' is a dictionary of math constants. The keys are the constant
    names from the MATH table specification (with capital first letter), and the
    values are the constant values as numbers.

    'italicsCorrections' is a dictionary of italic corrections. The keys are the
    glyph names, and the values are the italic corrections as numbers.

    'topAccentAttachments' is a dictionary of top accent attachments. The keys
    are the glyph names, and the values are the top accent horizontal positions
    as numbers.

    'extendedShapes' is a set of extended shape glyphs.

    'mathKerns' is a dictionary of math kerns. The keys are the glyph names, and
    the values are dictionaries. The keys of these dictionaries are the side
    names ('TopRight', 'TopLeft', 'BottomRight', 'BottomLeft'), and the values
    are tuples of two lists. The first list contains the correction heights as
    numbers, and the second list contains the kern values as numbers.

    'minConnectorOverlap' is the minimum connector overlap as a number.

    'vertGlyphVariants' is a dictionary of vertical glyph variants. The keys are
    the glyph names, and the values are tuples of glyph name and full advance height.

    'horizGlyphVariants' is a dictionary of horizontal glyph variants. The keys
    are the glyph names, and the values are tuples of glyph name and full
    advance width.

    'vertGlyphAssembly' is a dictionary of vertical glyph assemblies. The keys
    are the glyph names, and the values are tuples of assembly parts and italics
    correction. The assembly parts are tuples of glyph name, flags, start
    connector length, end connector length, and full advance height.

    'horizGlyphAssembly' is a dictionary of horizontal glyph assemblies. The
    keys are the glyph names, and the values are tuples of assembly parts
    and italics correction. The assembly parts are tuples of glyph name, flags,
    start connector length, end connector length, and full advance width.

    Where a number is expected, an integer or a float can be used. The floats
    will be rounded.
