    """Approximate a solution of the traveling salesman problem

    Compute a 3/2-approximation of the traveling salesman problem
    in a complete undirected graph using Christofides [1]_ algorithm.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : Graph
        `G` should be a complete weighted undirected graph.
        The distance between all pairs of nodes should be included.

    weight : string, optional (default="weight")
        Edge data key corresponding to the edge weight.
        If any edge does not have this attribute the weight is set to 1.

    tree : NetworkX graph or None (default: None)
        A minimum spanning tree of G. Or, if None, the minimum spanning
        tree is computed using :func:`networkx.minimum_spanning_tree`

    Returns
    -------
    list
        List of nodes in `G` along a cycle with a 3/2-approximation of
        the minimal Hamiltonian cycle.
