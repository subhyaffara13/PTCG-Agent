def is_d_separator(G, x, y, z):
    """Return whether node sets `x` and `y` are d-separated by `z`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : nx.DiGraph
        A NetworkX DAG.

    x : node or set of nodes
        First node or set of nodes in `G`.

    y : node or set of nodes
        Second node or set of nodes in `G`.

    z : node or set of nodes
        Potential separator (set of conditioning nodes in `G`). Can be empty set.

    Returns
    -------
    b : bool
        A boolean that is true if `x` is d-separated from `y` given `z` in `G`.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        The *d-separation* test is commonly used on disjoint sets of
        nodes in acyclic directed graphs.  Accordingly, the algorithm
        raises a :exc:`NetworkXError` if the node sets are not
        disjoint or if the input graph is not a DAG.

    NodeNotFound
        If any of the input nodes are not found in the graph,
        a :exc:`NodeNotFound` exception is raised

    Notes
    -----
    A d-separating set in a DAG is a set of nodes that
    blocks all paths between the two sets. Nodes in `z`
    block a path if they are part of the path and are not a collider,
    or a descendant of a collider. Also colliders that are not in `z`
    block a path. A collider structure along a path
    is ``... -> c <- ...`` where ``c`` is the collider node.
