def connected_caveman_graph(l, k):
    """Returns a connected caveman graph of `l` cliques of size `k`.

    The connected caveman graph is formed by creating `n` cliques of size
    `k`, then a single edge in each clique is rewired to a node in an
    adjacent clique.

    Parameters
    ----------
    l : int
      number of cliques
    k : int
      size of cliques (k at least 2 or NetworkXError is raised)

    Returns
    -------
    G : NetworkX Graph
      connected caveman graph

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        If the size of cliques `k` is smaller than 2.

    Notes
    -----
    This returns an undirected graph, it can be converted to a directed
    graph using :func:`nx.to_directed`, or a multigraph using
    ``nx.MultiGraph(nx.caveman_graph(l, k))``. Only the undirected version is
    described in [1]_ and it is unclear which of the directed
    generalizations is most useful.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.connected_caveman_graph(3, 3)
