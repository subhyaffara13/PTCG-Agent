    Deciphering is the same as enciphering but using the inverse of the
    key matrix.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.crypto.crypto import encipher_hill, decipher_hill
    >>> from sympy import Matrix

    >>> key = Matrix([[1, 2], [3, 5]])
    >>> encipher_hill("meet me on monday", key)
    'UEQDUEODOCTCWQ'
    >>> decipher_hill(_, key)
    'MEETMEONMONDAY'

    When the length of the plaintext (stripped of invalid characters)
    is not a multiple of the key dimension, extra characters will
    appear at the end of the enciphered and deciphered text. In order to
    decipher the text, those characters must be included in the text to
    be deciphered. In the following, the key has a dimension of 4 but
    the text is 2 short of being a multiple of 4 so two characters will
    be added.

    >>> key = Matrix([[1, 1, 1, 2], [0, 1, 1, 0],
    ...               [2, 2, 3, 4], [1, 1, 0, 1]])
    >>> msg = "ST"
    >>> encipher_hill(msg, key)
    'HJEB'
    >>> decipher_hill(_, key)
    'STQQ'
    >>> encipher_hill(msg, key, pad="Z")
    'ISPK'
    >>> decipher_hill(_, key)
    'STZZ'

    If the last two characters of the ciphertext were ignored in
    either case, the wrong plaintext would be recovered:

    >>> decipher_hill("HD", key)
    'ORMV'
    >>> decipher_hill("IS", key)
    'UIKY'
