    """Return a natural representation of a time in a resolution that makes sense.

    This is more or less compatible with Django's `naturaltime` filter.

    The time will be rounded to the nearest unit that makes sense.

    Args:
        value (datetime.datetime, datetime.timedelta, int or float): A `datetime`, a
            `timedelta`, or a number of seconds.
        future (bool): Ignored for `datetime`s and `timedelta`s, where the tense is
            always figured out based on the current time. For integers and floats, the
            return value will be past tense by default, unless future is `True`.
        months (bool): If `True`, then a number of months (based on 30.5 days) will be
            used for fuzziness between years.
        minimum_unit (str): The lowest unit that can be used.
        when (datetime.datetime): Point in time relative to which _value_ is
            interpreted.  Defaults to the current time in the local timezone.

    Returns:
        str: A natural representation of the input in a resolution that makes sense.
