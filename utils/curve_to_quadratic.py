    Args:
        cubic (sequence): Four 2D tuples representing control points of
            the cubic Bezier curve.
        max_err (double): Permitted deviation from the original curve.
        all_quadratic (bool): If True (default) returned value is a
            quadratic spline. If False, it's either a single quadratic
            curve or a single cubic curve.

    Returns:
        If all_quadratic is True: A list of 2D tuples representing
        control points of the quadratic spline.

        If all_quadratic is False: Either a quadratic curve (if length
        of output is 3), or a cubic curve (if length of output is 4).

    Raises:

        approximation can be found with the given parameters.
