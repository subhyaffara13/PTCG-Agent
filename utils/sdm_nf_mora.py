    r"""
    Compute a weak normal form of ``f`` with respect to ``G`` and order ``O``.

    The ground field is assumed to be ``K``, and monomials ordered according to
    ``O``.

    Weak normal forms are defined in [SCA, defn 2.3.3]. They are not unique.
    This function deterministically computes a weak normal form, depending on
    the order of `G`.

    The most important property of a weak normal form is the following: if
    `R` is the ring associated with the monomial ordering (if the ordering is
    global, we just have `R = K[x_1, \ldots, x_n]`, otherwise it is a certain
    localization thereof), `I` any ideal of `R` and `G` a standard basis for
    `I`, then for any `f \in R`, we have `f \in I` if and only if
    `NF(f | G) = 0`.

    This is the generalized Mora algorithm for computing weak normal forms with
    respect to arbitrary monomial orders [SCA, algorithm 2.3.9].

    If ``phantom`` is not ``None``, it should be a pair of "phantom" arguments
    on which to perform the same computations as on ``f``, ``G``, both results
    are then returned.
