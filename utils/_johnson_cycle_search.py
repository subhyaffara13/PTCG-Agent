    """The main loop of the cycle-enumeration algorithm of Johnson.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX Graph or DiGraph
       A graph

    path : list
       A cycle prefix.  All cycles generated will begin with this prefix.

    Yields
    ------
    list of nodes
       Each cycle is represented by a list of nodes along the cycle.
