    Modify ``hook`` to overlap :class:`ZeroRedundancyOptimizer` optimizer step with :class:`DistributedDataParallel` backward pass

    This approach overlaps the optimizer computation and communication with the
    backward computation and communication. In particular, once a bucket's
    gradients have been computed, the optimizer computation using those
    gradients is launched (though the actual computation must wait for the
    bucket's all-reduce to complete). This yields an interleaving of all-
    reduces and broadcasts in the communication stream.

    This approach may be preferred over :meth:`hook_with_zero_step` if
    communication is relatively fast compared to computation.

    Arguments:
        hook (Any * dist.GradBucket -> torch.futures.Future): the hook to
            modify.
        ddp (DistributedDataParallel): the :class:`DistributedDataParallel`
            instance to use.
        zero (ZeroRedundancyOptimizer): the :class:`ZeroRedundancyOptimizer`
            instance to use.
        shard_buckets (bool): if ``True``, then the assignment of each
            :class:`DistributedDataParallel` bucket is partitioned across
            possibly multiple :class:`ZeroRedundancyOptimizer` instances (i.e.
            across possibly multiple ranks) to approximate uniformity; if
            ``False``, then each bucket is wholly assigned to a single
            :class:`ZeroRedundancyOptimizer` instance (i.e. to a single rank).

    Returns:
        The modified hook.

    Raises:
        ValueError: if ``zero`` was constructed with ``overlap_with_ddp=False``.
        RuntimeError: if using any backend other than NCCL since currently
            Gloo may hang.

    .. warning::
        Given the way that overlapping :class:`DistributedDataParallel` with
        :class:`ZeroRedundancyOptimizer` is currently implemented, the first
        two or three training iterations do not perform parameter updates in
        the optimizer step, depending on if ``static_graph=False`` or
        ``static_graph=True``, respectively. This is because it needs
        information about the gradient bucketing strategy used by
        :class:`DistributedDataParallel`, which is not finalized until the
        second forward pass if ``static_graph=False`` or until the third
        forward pass if ``static_graph=True``.
