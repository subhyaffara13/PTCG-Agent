def _forward_jacobian_norm_in_cse_out(expr, wrt):
    """
    Function to compute the Jacobian of an input Matrix of expressions through
    forward accumulation. Takes a sympy Matrix of expressions (expr) as input
    and an iterable of variables (wrt) with respect to which to compute the
    Jacobian matrix. The matrix is returned in reduced form (containing
    replacement symbols) along with the ``replacements`` list.

    The function also returns a list of precomputed free symbols for each
    subexpression, which are useful in the substitution process.

    Parameters
    ==========

    expr : Matrix
        The vector to be differentiated.

    wrt : iterable
        The vector with respect to which to perform the differentiation.
        Can be a matrix or an iterable of variables.

    Returns
    =======

    replacements : list of (Symbol, expression) pairs
        Replacement symbols and relative common subexpressions that have been
        replaced during a CSE operation. The output replacement list doesn't
        contain replacement symbols inside ``Derivative``'s arguments.

    jacobian : list of SymPy expressions
        The list only contains one element, which is the Jacobian matrix with
        elements in reduced form (replacement symbols are present).

    precomputed_fs: list
        List of sets, which store the free symbols present in each
        sub-expression. Useful in the substitution process.
