    It will run the forward pass where all ExpandedWeights are their original

    .. note:: First argument in :attr:`expanded_args` must be the input with the batch
    dimension as the first element of the shape

    .. note:: :attr:`func` must return a Tensor or tuple of Tensors

    Args:
        func: The function to be called
        expanded_args: Arguments to be passed to :attr:`func`. Will include arguments
          that need to be unpacked because they are ExpandedWeights
        expanded_kwargs: Keyword arguments to be passed to :attr:`func`.
          Similar to :attr:`expanded_args`.
