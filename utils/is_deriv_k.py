    r"""
    Checks if Df/f is the derivative of an element of k(t).

    Explanation
    ===========

    a in k(t) is the derivative of an element of k(t) if there exists b in k(t)
    such that a = Db.  Either returns (ans, u), such that Df/f == Du, or None,
    which means that Df/f is not the derivative of an element of k(t).  ans is
    a list of tuples such that Add(*[i*j for i, j in ans]) == u.  This is useful
    for seeing exactly which elements of k(t) produce u.

    This function uses the structure theorem approach, which says that for any
    f in K, Df/f is the derivative of a element of K if and only if there are ri
    in QQ such that::

            ---               ---       Dt
            \    r  * Dt   +  \    r  *   i      Df
            /     i     i     /     i   ---   =  --.
            ---               ---        t        f
         i in L            i in E         i
               K/C(x)            K/C(x)


    Where C = Const(K), L_K/C(x) = { i in {1, ..., n} such that t_i is
    transcendental over C(x)(t_1, ..., t_i-1) and Dt_i = Da_i/a_i, for some a_i
    in C(x)(t_1, ..., t_i-1)* } (i.e., the set of all indices of logarithmic
    monomials of K over C(x)), and E_K/C(x) = { i in {1, ..., n} such that t_i
    is transcendental over C(x)(t_1, ..., t_i-1) and Dt_i/t_i = Da_i, for some
    a_i in C(x)(t_1, ..., t_i-1) } (i.e., the set of all indices of
    hyperexponential monomials of K over C(x)).  If K is an elementary extension
    over C(x), then the cardinality of L_K/C(x) U E_K/C(x) is exactly the
    transcendence degree of K over C(x).  Furthermore, because Const_D(K) ==
    Const_D(C(x)) == C, deg(Dt_i) == 1 when t_i is in E_K/C(x) and
    deg(Dt_i) == 0 when t_i is in L_K/C(x), implying in particular that E_K/C(x)
    and L_K/C(x) are disjoint.

    The sets L_K/C(x) and E_K/C(x) must, by their nature, be computed
    recursively using this same function.  Therefore, it is required to pass
    them as indices to D (or T).  E_args are the arguments of the
    hyperexponentials indexed by E_K (i.e., if i is in E_K, then T[i] ==
    exp(E_args[i])).  This is needed to compute the final answer u such that
    Df/f == Du.

    log(f) will be the same as u up to a additive constant.  This is because
    they will both behave the same as monomials. For example, both log(x) and
    log(2*x) == log(x) + log(2) satisfy Dt == 1/x, because log(2) is constant.
    Therefore, the term const is returned.  const is such that
    log(const) + f == u.  This is calculated by dividing the arguments of one
    logarithm from the other.  Therefore, it is necessary to pass the arguments
    of the logarithmic terms in L_args.

    To handle the case where we are given Df/f, not f, use is_deriv_k_in_field().
