def ordered_partitions(n, m=None, sort=True):
    """Generates ordered partitions of integer *n*.

    Parameters
    ==========
    n : int
    m : int, optional
        The default value gives partitions of all sizes else only
        those with size m. In addition, if *m* is not None then
        partitions are generated *in place* (see examples).
    sort : bool, default: True
        Controls whether partitions are
        returned in sorted order when *m* is not None; when False,
        the partitions are returned as fast as possible with elements
        sorted, but when m|n the partitions will not be in
        ascending lexicographical order.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.utilities.iterables import ordered_partitions

    All partitions of 5 in ascending lexicographical:

    >>> for p in ordered_partitions(5):
    ...     print(p)
    [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
    [1, 1, 1, 2]
    [1, 1, 3]
    [1, 2, 2]
    [1, 4]
    [2, 3]
    [5]

    Only partitions of 5 with two parts:

    >>> for p in ordered_partitions(5, 2):
    ...     print(p)
    [1, 4]
    [2, 3]

    When ``m`` is given, a given list objects will be used more than
    once for speed reasons so you will not see the correct partitions
    unless you make a copy of each as it is generated:

    >>> [p for p in ordered_partitions(7, 3)]
    [[1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 2]]
    >>> [list(p) for p in ordered_partitions(7, 3)]
    [[1, 1, 5], [1, 2, 4], [1, 3, 3], [2, 2, 3]]

    When ``n`` is a multiple of ``m``, the elements are still sorted
    but the partitions themselves will be *unordered* if sort is False;
    the default is to return them in ascending lexicographical order.

    >>> for p in ordered_partitions(6, 2):
    ...     print(p)
    [1, 5]
    [2, 4]
    [3, 3]

    But if speed is more important than ordering, sort can be set to
    False:

    >>> for p in ordered_partitions(6, 2, sort=False):
    ...     print(p)
    [1, 5]
    [3, 3]
    [2, 4]
