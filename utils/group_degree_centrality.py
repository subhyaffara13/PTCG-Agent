def group_degree_centrality(G, S):
    """Compute the group degree centrality for a group of nodes.

    Group degree centrality of a group of nodes $S$ is the fraction
    of non-group members connected to group members.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
       A NetworkX graph.

    S : list or set
       S is a group of nodes which belong to G, for which group degree
       centrality is to be calculated.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
       If node(s) in S are not in G.

    Returns
    -------
    centrality : float
       Group degree centrality of the group S.

    See Also
    --------
    degree_centrality
    group_in_degree_centrality
    group_out_degree_centrality

    Notes
    -----
    The measure was introduced in [1]_.

    The number of nodes in the group must be a maximum of n - 1 where `n`
    is the total number of nodes in the graph.
