    """
    Scatters picklable objects in ``scatter_object_input_list`` to the whole group.

    Similar to :func:`scatter`, but Python objects can be passed in. On
    each rank, the scattered object will be stored as the first element of
    ``scatter_object_output_list``. Note that all objects in
    ``scatter_object_input_list`` must be picklable in order to be scattered.

    Args:
        scatter_object_output_list (List[Any]): Non-empty list whose first
            element will store the object scattered to this rank.
        scatter_object_input_list (List[Any], optional): List of input objects to scatter.
            Each object must be picklable. Only objects on the ``src`` rank will
            be scattered, and the argument can be ``None`` for non-src ranks.
        src (int): Source rank from which to scatter ``scatter_object_input_list``.
            Source rank is based on global process group (regardless of ``group`` argument).
            (If both ``src`` and ``group_src`` are None, default is global rank 0)
        group: (ProcessGroup, optional): The process group to work on. If None,
            the default process group will be used. Default is ``None``.
        group_src (int, optional): Source rank on ``group``.  Invalid to specify both ``src`` and ``group_src``

    Returns:
        ``None``. If rank is part of the group, ``scatter_object_output_list``
        will have its first element set to the scattered object for this rank.

    .. note:: Note that this API differs slightly from the scatter collective
        since it does not provide an ``async_op`` handle and thus will be a
        blocking call.

    .. warning::
        Object collectives have a number of serious performance and scalability
        limitations.  See :ref:`object_collectives` for details.

    .. warning::
        :func:`scatter_object_list` uses ``pickle`` module implicitly, which
        is known to be insecure. It is possible to construct malicious pickle
        data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling. Only call this
        function with data you trust.

    .. warning::
        Calling :func:`scatter_object_list` with GPU tensors is not well supported
        and inefficient as it incurs GPU -> CPU transfer since tensors would be
        pickled. Please consider using :func:`scatter` instead.

    Example::
        >>> # xdoctest: +SKIP("need process group init")
        >>> # Note: Process group initialization omitted on each rank.
        >>> import torch.distributed as dist
        >>> if dist.get_rank() == 0:
        >>>     # Assumes world_size of 3.
        >>>     objects = ["foo", 12, {1: 2}] # any picklable object
        >>> else:
        >>>     # Can be any list on non-src ranks, elements are not used.
        >>>     objects = [None, None, None]
        >>> output_list = [None]
        >>> dist.scatter_object_list(output_list, objects, src=0)
        >>> # Rank i gets objects[i]. For example, on rank 2:
        >>> output_list
        [{1: 2}]
