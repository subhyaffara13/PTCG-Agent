def logcombine(expr, force=False):
    """
    Takes logarithms and combines them using the following rules:

    - log(x) + log(y) == log(x*y) if both are positive
    - a*log(x) == log(x**a) if x is positive and a is real

    If ``force`` is ``True`` then the assumptions above will be assumed to hold if
    there is no assumption already in place on a quantity. For example, if
    ``a`` is imaginary or the argument negative, force will not perform a
    combination but if ``a`` is a symbol with no assumptions the change will
    take place.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import Symbol, symbols, log, logcombine, I
    >>> from sympy.abc import a, x, y, z
    >>> logcombine(a*log(x) + log(y) - log(z))
    a*log(x) + log(y) - log(z)
    >>> logcombine(a*log(x) + log(y) - log(z), force=True)
    log(x**a*y/z)
    >>> x,y,z = symbols('x,y,z', positive=True)
    >>> a = Symbol('a', real=True)
    >>> logcombine(a*log(x) + log(y) - log(z))
    log(x**a*y/z)

    The transformation is limited to factors and/or terms that
    contain logs, so the result depends on the initial state of
    expansion:

    >>> eq = (2 + 3*I)*log(x)
    >>> logcombine(eq, force=True) == eq
    True
    >>> logcombine(eq.expand(), force=True)
    log(x**2) + I*log(x**3)
