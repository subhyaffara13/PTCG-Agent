def topological_generations(G):
    """Stratifies a DAG into generations.

    A topological generation is node collection in which ancestors of a node in each
    generation are guaranteed to be in a previous generation, and any descendants of
    a node are guaranteed to be in a following generation. Nodes are guaranteed to
    be in the earliest possible generation that they can belong to.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX digraph
        A directed acyclic graph (DAG)

    Yields
    ------
    sets of nodes
        Yields sets of nodes representing each generation.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        Generations are defined for directed graphs only. If the graph
        `G` is undirected, a :exc:`NetworkXError` is raised.

    NetworkXUnfeasible
        If `G` is not a directed acyclic graph (DAG) no topological generations
        exist and a :exc:`NetworkXUnfeasible` exception is raised.  This can also
        be raised if `G` is changed while the returned iterator is being processed

    RuntimeError
        If `G` is changed while the returned iterator is being processed.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> DG = nx.DiGraph([(2, 1), (3, 1)])
    >>> [sorted(generation) for generation in nx.topological_generations(DG)]
    [[2, 3], [1]]

    Notes
    -----
    The generation in which a node resides can also be determined by taking the
    max-path-distance from the node to the farthest leaf node. That value can
    be obtained with this function using `enumerate(topological_generations(G))`.
