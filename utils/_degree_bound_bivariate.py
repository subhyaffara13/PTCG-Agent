def _degree_bound_bivariate(f, g):
    r"""
    Compute upper degree bounds for the GCD of two bivariate
    integer polynomials `f` and `g`.

    The GCD is viewed as a polynomial in `\mathbb{Z}[y][x]` and the
    function returns an upper bound for its degree and one for the degree
    of its content. This is done by choosing a suitable prime `p` and
    computing the GCD of the contents of `f \; \mathrm{mod} \, p` and
    `g \; \mathrm{mod} \, p`. The choice of `p` guarantees that the degree
    of the content in `\mathbb{Z}_p[y]` is greater than or equal to the
    degree in `\mathbb{Z}[y]`. To obtain the degree bound in the variable
    `x`, the polynomials are evaluated at `y = a` for a suitable
    `a \in \mathbb{Z}_p` and then their GCD in `\mathbb{Z}_p[x]` is
    computed. If no such `a` exists, i.e. the degree in `\mathbb{Z}_p[x]`
    is always smaller than the one in `\mathbb{Z}[y][x]`, then the bound is
    set to the minimum of the degrees of `f` and `g` in `x`.
