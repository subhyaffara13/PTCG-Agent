def match_real_imag(expr):
    r"""
    Try to match expr with $a + Ib$ for real $a$ and $b$.

    ``match_real_imag`` returns a tuple containing the real and imaginary
    parts of expr or ``(None, None)`` if direct matching is not possible. Contrary
    to :func:`~.re`, :func:`~.im``, and ``as_real_imag()``, this helper will not force things
    by returning expressions themselves containing ``re()`` or ``im()`` and it
    does not expand its argument either.

        return (r_, i_)

    if i_ and i_.is_real and r_.is_real:
        return (r_, i_)
    else:
        return (None, None) # simpler to check for than None
