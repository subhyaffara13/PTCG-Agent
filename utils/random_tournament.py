def random_tournament(n, seed=None):
    r"""Returns a random tournament graph on `n` nodes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : int
        The number of nodes in the returned graph.
    seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
        Indicator of random number generation state.
        See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.

    Returns
    -------
    G : DiGraph
        A tournament on `n` nodes, with exactly one directed edge joining
        each pair of distinct nodes.

    Notes
    -----
    This algorithm adds, for each pair of distinct nodes, an edge with
    uniformly random orientation. In other words, `\binom{n}{2}` flips
    of an unbiased coin decide the orientations of the edges in the
    graph.

    """
    # Flip an unbiased coin for each pair of distinct nodes.
    coins = (seed.random() for i in range((n * (n - 1)) // 2))
    pairs = combinations(range(n), 2)
    edges = ((u, v) if r < 0.5 else (v, u) for (u, v), r in zip(pairs, coins))
    return nx.DiGraph(edges)
