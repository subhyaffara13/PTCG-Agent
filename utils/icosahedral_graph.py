def icosahedral_graph(create_using=None):
    """
    Returns the Platonic Icosahedral graph.

    The icosahedral graph has 12 nodes and 30 edges. It is a Platonic graph
    whose nodes have the connectivity of the icosahedron. It is undirected,
    regular and Hamiltonian [1]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    create_using : NetworkX graph constructor, optional (default=nx.Graph)
       Graph type to create. If graph instance, then cleared before populated.

    Returns
    -------
    G : networkx Graph
        Icosahedral graph with 12 nodes and 30 edges.
