def projections(A, method=None, orth_tol=1e-12, max_refin=3, tol=1e-15):
    """Return three linear operators related with a given matrix A.

    Parameters
    ----------
    A : sparse array (or ndarray), shape (m, n)
        Matrix ``A`` used in the projection.
    method : str, optional
        Method used for compute the given linear
        operators. Should be one of:

            - 'NormalEquation': The operators
               will be computed using the
               so-called normal equation approach
               explained in [1]_. In order to do
               so the Cholesky factorization of
               ``(A A.T)`` is computed. Exclusive
               for sparse matrices.
            - 'AugmentedSystem': The operators
               will be computed using the
               so-called augmented system approach
               explained in [1]_. Exclusive
               for sparse matrices.
            - 'QRFactorization': Compute projections
               using QR factorization. Exclusive for
               dense matrices.
            - 'SVDFactorization': Compute projections
               using SVD factorization. Exclusive for
               dense matrices.

    orth_tol : float, optional
        Tolerance for iterative refinements.
    max_refin : int, optional
        Maximum number of iterative refinements.
    tol : float, optional
        Tolerance for singular values.

    Returns
    -------
    Z : LinearOperator, shape (n, n)
        Null-space operator. For a given vector ``x``,
        the null space operator is equivalent to apply
        a projection matrix ``P = I - A.T inv(A A.T) A``
        to the vector. It can be shown that this is
        equivalent to project ``x`` into the null space
        of A.
    LS : LinearOperator, shape (m, n)
        Least-squares operator. For a given vector ``x``,
        the least-squares operator is equivalent to apply a
        pseudoinverse matrix ``pinv(A.T) = inv(A A.T) A``
        to the vector. It can be shown that this vector
        ``pinv(A.T) x`` is the least_square solution to
        ``A.T y = x``.
    Y : LinearOperator, shape (n, m)
        Row-space operator. For a given vector ``x``,
        the row-space operator is equivalent to apply a
        projection matrix ``Q = A.T inv(A A.T)``
        to the vector.  It can be shown that this
        vector ``y = Q x``  the minimum norm solution
        of ``A y = x``.

    Notes
    -----
    Uses iterative refinements described in [1]
    during the computation of ``Z`` in order to
    cope with the possibility of large roundoff errors.
