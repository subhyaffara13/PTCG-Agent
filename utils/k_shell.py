def k_shell(G, k=None, core_number=None):
    """Returns the k-shell of G.

    The k-shell is the subgraph induced by nodes with core number k.
    That is, nodes in the k-core that are not in the (k+1)-core.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
      A graph or directed graph.
    k : int, optional
      The order of the shell. If not specified return the outer shell.
    core_number : dictionary, optional
      Precomputed core numbers for the graph G.


    Returns
    -------
    G : NetworkX graph
       The k-shell subgraph

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXNotImplemented
        The k-shell is not implemented for multigraphs or graphs with self loops.

    Notes
    -----
    This is similar to k_corona but in that case only neighbors in the
    k-core are considered.

    For directed graphs the node degree is defined to be the
    in-degree + out-degree.

    Graph, node, and edge attributes are copied to the subgraph.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> degrees = [0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3]
    >>> H = nx.havel_hakimi_graph(degrees)
    >>> H.degree
    DegreeView({0: 1, 1: 2, 2: 2, 3: 2, 4: 2, 5: 3, 6: 0})
    >>> nx.k_shell(H, k=1).nodes
    NodeView((0, 4))
