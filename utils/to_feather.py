    Write a DataFrame to the binary Feather format.

    Parameters
    ----------
    df : DataFrame
    path : str, path object, or file-like object
    storage_options : dict, optional
        Extra options that make sense for a particular storage connection, e.g.
        host, port, username, password, etc. For HTTP(S) URLs the key-value pairs
        are forwarded to ``urllib.request.Request`` as header options. For other
        URLs (e.g. starting with "s3://", and "gcs://") the key-value pairs are
        forwarded to ``fsspec.open``. Please see ``fsspec`` and ``urllib`` for more
        details, and for more examples on storage options refer `here
        <https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/io.html?
        highlight=storage_options#reading-writing-remote-files>`_.
    **kwargs :
        Additional keywords passed to `pyarrow.feather.write_feather`.
