def _af_parity(pi):
    """
    Computes the parity of a permutation in array form.

    Explanation
    ===========

    The parity of a permutation reflects the parity of the
    number of inversions in the permutation, i.e., the
    number of pairs of x and y such that x > y but p[x] < p[y].

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.combinatorics.permutations import _af_parity
    >>> _af_parity([0, 1, 2, 3])
    0
    >>> _af_parity([3, 2, 0, 1])
    1
