def supplement_a_subspace(M):
    r"""
    Extend a basis for a subspace to a basis for the whole space.

    Explanation
    ===========

    Given an $n \times r$ matrix *M* of rank $r$ (so $r \leq n$), this function
    computes an invertible $n \times n$ matrix $B$ such that the first $r$
    columns of $B$ equal *M*.

    This operation can be interpreted as a way of extending a basis for a
    subspace, to give a basis for the whole space.

    To be precise, suppose you have an $n$-dimensional vector space $V$, with
    basis $\{v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n\}$, and an $r$-dimensional subspace $W$ of
    $V$, spanned by a basis $\{w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_r\}$, where the $w_j$ are
    given as linear combinations of the $v_i$. If the columns of *M* represent
    the $w_j$ as such linear combinations, then the columns of the matrix $B$
    computed by this function give a new basis $\{u_1, u_2, \ldots, u_n\}$ for
    $V$, again relative to the $\{v_i\}$ basis, and such that $u_j = w_j$
    for $1 \leq j \leq r$.

    Examples
    ========

    Note: The function works in terms of columns, so in these examples we
    print matrix transposes in order to make the columns easier to inspect.

    >>> from sympy.polys.matrices import DM
    >>> from sympy import QQ, FF
    >>> from sympy.polys.numberfields.utilities import supplement_a_subspace
    >>> M = DM([[1, 7, 0], [2, 3, 4]], QQ).transpose()
    >>> print(supplement_a_subspace(M).to_Matrix().transpose())
    Matrix([[1, 7, 0], [2, 3, 4], [1, 0, 0]])

    >>> M2 = M.convert_to(FF(7))
    >>> print(M2.to_Matrix().transpose())
    Matrix([[1, 0, 0], [2, 3, -3]])
    >>> print(supplement_a_subspace(M2).to_Matrix().transpose())
    Matrix([[1, 0, 0], [2, 3, -3], [0, 1, 0]])

    Parameters
    ==========

    M : :py:class:`~.DomainMatrix`
        The columns give the basis for the subspace.

    Returns
    =======

    :py:class:`~.DomainMatrix`
        This matrix is invertible and its first $r$ columns equal *M*.

    Raises
    ======

    DMRankError
        If *M* was not of maximal rank.
