def to_graph6_bytes(G, nodes=None, header=True):
    """Convert a simple undirected graph to bytes in graph6 format.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : Graph (undirected)

    nodes: list or iterable
       Nodes are labeled 0...n-1 in the order provided.  If None the ordering
       given by ``G.nodes()`` is used.

    header: bool
       If True add '>>graph6<<' bytes to head of data.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXNotImplemented
        If the graph is directed or is a multigraph.

    ValueError
        If the graph has at least ``2 ** 36`` nodes; the graph6 format
        is only defined for graphs of order less than ``2 ** 36``.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> nx.to_graph6_bytes(nx.path_graph(2))
    b'>>graph6<<A_\\n'

    See Also
    --------
    from_graph6_bytes, read_graph6, write_graph6_bytes

    Notes
    -----
    The returned bytes end with a newline character.

    The format does not support edge or node labels, parallel edges or
    self loops. If self loops are present they are silently ignored.
