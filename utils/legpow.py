def legpow(c, pow, maxpower=16):
    """Raise a Legendre series to a power.

    Returns the Legendre series `c` raised to the power `pow`. The
    argument `c` is a sequence of coefficients ordered from low to high.
    i.e., [1,2,3] is the series  ``P_0 + 2*P_1 + 3*P_2.``

    Parameters
    ----------
    c : array_like
        1-D array of Legendre series coefficients ordered from low to
        high.
    pow : integer
        Power to which the series will be raised
    maxpower : integer, optional
        Maximum power allowed. This is mainly to limit growth of the series
        to unmanageable size. Default is 16

    Returns
    -------
    coef : ndarray
        Legendre series of power.
