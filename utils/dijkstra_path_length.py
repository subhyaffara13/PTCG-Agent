def dijkstra_path_length(G, source, target, weight="weight"):
    """Returns the shortest weighted path length in G from source to target.

    Uses Dijkstra's Method to compute the shortest weighted path length
    between two nodes in a graph.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    source : node label
        starting node for path

    target : node label
        ending node for path

    weight : string or function
        If this is a string, then edge weights will be accessed via the
        edge attribute with this key (that is, the weight of the edge
        joining `u` to `v` will be ``G.edges[u, v][weight]``). If no
        such edge attribute exists, the weight of the edge is assumed to
        be one.

        If this is a function, the weight of an edge is the value
        returned by the function. The function must accept exactly three
        positional arguments: the two endpoints of an edge and the
        dictionary of edge attributes for that edge. The function must
        return a number or None to indicate a hidden edge.

    Returns
    -------
    length : number
        Shortest path length.

    Raises
    ------
    NodeNotFound
        If `source` is not in `G`.

    NetworkXNoPath
        If no path exists between source and target.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.path_graph(5)
    >>> nx.dijkstra_path_length(G, 0, 4)
    4

    Notes
    -----
    Edge weight attributes must be numerical.
    Distances are calculated as sums of weighted edges traversed.

    The weight function can be used to hide edges by returning None.
    So ``weight = lambda u, v, d: 1 if d['color']=="red" else None``
    will find the shortest red path.

    The function :func:`single_source_dijkstra` computes both
    path and length-of-path if you need both, use that.
