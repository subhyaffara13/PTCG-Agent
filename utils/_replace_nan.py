def _replace_nan(a, val):
    """
    If `a` is of inexact type, make a copy of `a`, replace NaNs with
    the `val` value, and return the copy together with a boolean mask
    marking the locations where NaNs were present. If `a` is not of
    inexact type, do nothing and return `a` together with a mask of None.

    Note that scalars will end up as array scalars, which is important
    for using the result as the value of the out argument in some
    operations.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array-like
        Input array.
    val : float
        NaN values are set to val before doing the operation.

    Returns
    -------
    y : ndarray
        If `a` is of inexact type, return a copy of `a` with the NaNs
        replaced by the fill value, otherwise return `a`.
    mask: {bool, None}
        If `a` is of inexact type, return a boolean mask marking locations of
        NaNs, otherwise return None.
