    Move non-tensor nodes on the boundary between subgraphs.

    1. Find nodes whose type is not tensor and any of its children is in another
       subgraph, put them in a queue for next step

    2. Do a BFS on those nodes in the queue,  and run a DFS for each node, let's say node X and it is in subgraph A:

       a. if it is in to_subgraph, return (continue DFS)
       b. if it is in from_subgraph, collect the nodes to nodes_to_move, and continue DFS

       d. also check if node X's parent should be put into the queue. (The queue may
          have duplicated nodes, just process the node once)
