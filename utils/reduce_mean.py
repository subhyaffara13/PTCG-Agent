def reduce_mean(values, index, name="segmented_reduce_mean"):
    """
    Averages a tensor over its segments.

    Outputs 0 for empty segments.

    This operations computes the mean over segments, with support for:

        - Batching using the first dimensions [B1, B2, ..., Bn]. Each element in a batch can have different indices.
        - Vectorization using the last dimension [V1, V2, ...]. If they are present, the output will be a mean of
          vectors rather than scalars.

    Only the middle dimensions [I1, ..., Ik] are reduced by the operation.

    Args:
        values (`torch.Tensor` of shape [B1, B2, ..., Bn, I1, .., Ik, V1, V2, ..]):
            Tensor containing the values of which the mean must be taken segment-wise.
        index (`IndexMap`, indices are of shape [B1, B2, ..., Bn, I1, .., Ik].):
            Index defining the segments.
        name (`str`, *optional*, defaults to 'segmented_reduce_sum'):
            Name for the operation. Currently not used

    Returns:
        output_values (`torch.Tensor`of shape [B1, B2, ..., Bn, num_segments, V1, V2, ..]): Tensor containing the
        output values. output_index (`IndexMap`): IndexMap with shape [B1, B2, ..., Bn, num_segments].
