def get_slices(lines, clean_lines):
    """
    Get slices of text based on specific criteria within the lines.

    This function identifies and returns slices of text from the input lines based on certain conditions.

    These conditions were chosen by the Nougat authors:
    - The slice is less than 200 characters long.
    - The slice is more than 3 characters long.
    - The slice does not start with "[MISSING_PAGE".
    - The slice is either the same as the next slice or the ratio of the two in terms of Levenshtein distance is
      greater than 0.9.

    Args:
        lines (`list[str]`):
            The list of lines containing the text.
        clean_lines (`list[str]`):
            A cleaned version of the text (without numbers).

    Returns:
        `list[tuple]`: A list of tuples representing the start and end indices of text slices.
