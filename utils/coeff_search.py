def coeff_search(m, R):
    r"""
    Generate coefficients for searching through polynomials.

    Explanation
    ===========

    Lead coeff is always non-negative. Explore all combinations with coeffs
    bounded in absolute value before increasing the bound. Skip the all-zero
    list, and skip any repeats. See examples.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.polys.numberfields.utilities import coeff_search
    >>> cs = coeff_search(2, 1)
    >>> C = [next(cs) for i in range(13)]
    >>> print(C)
    [[1, 1], [1, 0], [1, -1], [0, 1], [2, 2], [2, 1], [2, 0], [2, -1], [2, -2],
     [1, 2], [1, -2], [0, 2], [3, 3]]

    Parameters
    ==========

    m : int
        Length of coeff list.
    R : int
        Initial max abs val for coeffs (will increase as search proceeds).

    Returns
    =======

    generator
        Infinite generator of lists of coefficients.
