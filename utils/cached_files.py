    """
    Tries to locate several files in a local folder and repo, downloads and cache them if necessary.

    Args:
        path_or_repo_id (`str` or `os.PathLike`):
            This can be either:
            - a string, the *model id* of a model repo on huggingface.co.
            - a path to a *directory* potentially containing the file.
        filenames (`list[str]`):
            The name of all the files to locate in `path_or_repo`.
        cache_dir (`str` or `os.PathLike`, *optional*):
            Path to a directory in which a downloaded pretrained model configuration should be cached if the standard
            cache should not be used.
        force_download (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether or not to force to (re-)download the configuration files and override the cached versions if they
            exist.
        proxies (`dict[str, str]`, *optional*):
            A dictionary of proxy servers to use by protocol or endpoint, e.g., `{'http': 'foo.bar:3128',
            'http://hostname': 'foo.bar:4012'}.` The proxies are used on each request.
        token (`str` or *bool*, *optional*):
            The token to use as HTTP bearer authorization for remote files. If `True`, will use the token generated
            when running `hf auth login` (stored in `~/.huggingface`).
        revision (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"main"`):
            The specific model version to use. It can be a branch name, a tag name, or a commit id, since we use a
            git-based system for storing models and other artifacts on huggingface.co, so `revision` can be any
            identifier allowed by git.
        local_files_only (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            If `True`, will only try to load the tokenizer configuration from local files.
        subfolder (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `""`):
            In case the relevant files are located inside a subfolder of the model repo on huggingface.co, you can
            specify the folder name here.
        repo_type (`str`, *optional*):
            Specify the repo type (useful when downloading from a space for instance).

    Private args:
        _raise_exceptions_for_gated_repo (`bool`):
            if False, do not raise an exception for gated repo error but return None.
        _raise_exceptions_for_missing_entries (`bool`):
            if False, do not raise an exception for missing entries but return None.
        _raise_exceptions_for_connection_errors (`bool`):
            if False, do not raise an exception for connection errors but return None.
        _commit_hash (`str`, *optional*):
            passed when we are chaining several calls to various files (e.g. when loading a tokenizer or
            a pipeline). If files are cached for this commit hash, avoid calls to head and get from the cache.

    <Tip>

    Passing `token=True` is required when you want to use a private model.

    </Tip>

    Returns:
        `Optional[str]`: Returns the resolved file (to the cache folder if downloaded from a repo).

    Examples:

    ```python
    # Download a model weight from the Hub and cache it.
    model_weights_file = cached_file("google-bert/bert-base-uncased", "pytorch_model.bin")
    ```
