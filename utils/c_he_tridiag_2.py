    """
    This routine applied the unitary matrix Q described in c_he_tridiag_0
    onto the the matrix B, i.e. it forms Q*B.

    parameters:
      A    (input) On input, A is the same matrix as delivered by c_he_tridiag_0.

      T    (input) On input, T is the same array as delivered by c_he_tridiag_0.

      B    (input/output) On input, B is a complex matrix. On output B is replaced
           by Q*B.

    This routine is a python translation of the fortran routine htribk.f in the
    software library EISPACK (see netlib.org). See c_he_tridiag_0 for more
    references.
