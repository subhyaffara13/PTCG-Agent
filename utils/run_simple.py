    """Start a development server for a WSGI application. Various
    optional features can be enabled.

    .. warning::

        Do not use the development server when deploying to production.
        It is intended for use only during local development. It is not
        designed to be particularly efficient, stable, or secure.

    :param hostname: The host to bind to, for example ``'localhost'``.
        Can be a domain, IPv4 or IPv6 address, or file path starting
        with ``unix://`` for a Unix socket.
    :param port: The port to bind to, for example ``8080``. Using ``0``
        tells the OS to pick a random free port.
    :param application: The WSGI application to run.
    :param use_reloader: Use a reloader process to restart the server
        process when files are changed.
    :param use_debugger: Use Werkzeug's debugger, which will show
        formatted tracebacks on unhandled exceptions.
    :param use_evalex: Make the debugger interactive. A Python terminal
        can be opened for any frame in the traceback. Some protection is
        provided by requiring a PIN, but this should never be enabled
        on a publicly visible server.
    :param extra_files: The reloader will watch these files for changes
        in addition to Python modules. For example, watch a
        configuration file.
    :param exclude_patterns: The reloader will ignore changes to any
        files matching these :mod:`fnmatch` patterns. For example,
        ignore cache files.
    :param reloader_interval: How often the reloader tries to check for
        changes.
    :param reloader_type: The reloader to use. The ``'stat'`` reloader
        is built in, but may require significant CPU to watch files. The
        ``'watchdog'`` reloader is much more efficient but requires
        installing the ``watchdog`` package first.
    :param threaded: Handle concurrent requests using threads. Cannot be
        used with ``processes``.
    :param processes: Handle concurrent requests using up to this number
        of processes. Cannot be used with ``threaded``.
    :param request_handler: Use a different
        :class:`~BaseHTTPServer.BaseHTTPRequestHandler` subclass to
        handle requests.
    :param static_files: A dict mapping URL prefixes to directories to
        serve static files from using
        :class:`~werkzeug.middleware.SharedDataMiddleware`.
    :param passthrough_errors: Don't catch unhandled exceptions at the
        server level, let the server crash instead. If ``use_debugger``
        is enabled, the debugger will still catch such errors.
    :param ssl_context: Configure TLS to serve over HTTPS. Can be an
        :class:`ssl.SSLContext` object, a ``(cert_file, key_file)``
        tuple to create a typical context, or the string ``'adhoc'`` to
        generate a temporary self-signed certificate.

    .. versionchanged:: 2.1
        Instructions are shown for dealing with an "address already in
        use" error.

    .. versionchanged:: 2.1
        Running on ``0.0.0.0`` or ``::`` shows the loopback IP in
        addition to a real IP.

    .. versionchanged:: 2.1
        The command-line interface was removed.

    .. versionchanged:: 2.0
        Running on ``0.0.0.0`` or ``::`` shows a real IP address that
        was bound as well as a warning not to run the development server
        in production.

    .. versionchanged:: 2.0
        The ``exclude_patterns`` parameter was added.

    .. versionchanged:: 0.15
        Bind to a Unix socket by passing a ``hostname`` that starts with
        ``unix://``.

    .. versionchanged:: 0.10
        Improved the reloader and added support for changing the backend
        through the ``reloader_type`` parameter.

    .. versionchanged:: 0.9
        A command-line interface was added.

    .. versionchanged:: 0.8
        ``ssl_context`` can be a tuple of paths to the certificate and
        private key files.

    .. versionchanged:: 0.6
        The ``ssl_context`` parameter was added.

    .. versionchanged:: 0.5
       The ``static_files`` and ``passthrough_errors`` parameters were
       added.
