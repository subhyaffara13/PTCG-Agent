    This lowers an invocation of foreach_map
    The way this works is that an arbitrary N-arg func is provided by the user, looped over by the
    polyfill with the same semantics as a foreach op (a loop applying an n-ary function to n args)
    and then traced into a subgraph by dynamo.
    This code allows us to inline the subgraph into the main graph lowering using the PontwiseSubgraphLowering.
    The graph outputs represent the vertically fused sequence of ops, and then register_operation_list
    below registers the buffers as horizontally fuseable in the scheduler.
