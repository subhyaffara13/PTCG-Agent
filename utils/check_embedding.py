    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
    embedding : a dict mapping nodes to a list of edges
        This specifies the ordering of the outgoing edges from a node for
        a combinatorial embedding

    Notes
    -----
    Checks the following things:
        - The type of the embedding is correct
        - The nodes and edges match the original graph
        - Every half edge has its matching opposite half edge
        - No intersections of edges (checked by Euler's formula)
