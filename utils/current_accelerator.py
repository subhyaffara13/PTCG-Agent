def current_accelerator(check_available: bool = False) -> torch.device | None:
    r"""Return the device of the accelerator available at compilation time.
    If no accelerator were available at compilation time, returns None.
    See :ref:`accelerator<accelerators>` for details.

    Args:
        check_available (bool, optional): if True, will also do a runtime check to see
            if the device :func:`torch.accelerator.is_available` on top of the compile-time
            check.
            Default: ``False``

    Returns:
        torch.device: return the current accelerator as :class:`torch.device`.

    .. note:: The index of the returned :class:`torch.device` will be ``None``, please use
        :func:`torch.accelerator.current_device_index` to know the current index being used.
        This API does NOT poison fork. For more details, see :ref:`multiprocessing-poison-fork-note`.

    Example::

        >>> # xdoctest:
        >>> # If an accelerator is available, sent the model to it
        >>> model = torch.nn.Linear(2, 2)
        >>> if (current_device := current_accelerator(check_available=True)) is not None:
        >>>     model.to(current_device)

    if (acc := torch._C._accelerator_getAccelerator()) is not None:
        if (not check_available) or (check_available and is_available()):
            return acc
