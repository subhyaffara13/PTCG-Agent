) -> list[torch.Tensor | BlockMask]:
    """
    Shard the buffers along the specified sequence dimensions (`seq_dims`), so that each
    rank retains only its corresponding shard according to the provided `mesh`. If a
    `load_balancer` is provided, the buffers will be rearranged by the load balancer
    before sharding to improve load balance. Buffers can be either tensors or `BlockMask`
    objects. If a buffer is a `BlockMask`, its sharding dimension is determined by the
    `BlockMask` implementation, and the corresponding `seq_dim` is ignored.

    Note:
        For `_context_parallel_shard`, a non-None `load_balancer` must be explicitly passed
        if load balancing is required.

    Args:
        mesh (DeviceMesh): The device mesh used for context parallelism.
        buffers (List[torch.Tensor | BlockMask]): Buffers whose usage depends on the sequence
            dimension. Examples include input batches, labels, and positional embedding buffers.
            These buffers must be sharded along the sequence dimension to ensure correctness.
        seq_dims (List[int]): The sequence dimensions for each buffer in `buffers`. Must have
            the same length as `buffers`.
        load_balancer (Optional[_LoadBalancer]): An optional load balancer object. If provided,
            it rearranges the buffers before sharding to achieve better load balance. If not
            provided, no rearrangement is performed.

    Returns:
        List[torch.Tensor | BlockMask]: The sharded buffers, each corresponding to the local
            shard for the current rank.
