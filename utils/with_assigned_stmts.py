    This enables only inference for name binding in a *with* statement.
    For instance, in the following code, inferring `func` will return
    the `ContextManager` class, not whatever ``__enter__`` returns.
    We are doing this intentionally, because we consider that the context
    manager result is whatever __enter__ returns and what it is binded
    using the ``as`` keyword.

        class ContextManager(object):

        # ContextManager().infer() will return ContextManager
        # f.infer() will return 42.
