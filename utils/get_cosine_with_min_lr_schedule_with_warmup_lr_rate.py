    Create a schedule with a learning rate that decreases following the values of the cosine function between the
    initial lr set in the optimizer to min_lr, after a warmup period during which it increases linearly between 0 and the
    initial lr set in the optimizer.

    Args:
        optimizer ([`~torch.optim.Optimizer`]):
            The optimizer for which to schedule the learning rate.
        num_warmup_steps (`int`):
            The number of steps for the warmup phase.
        num_training_steps (`int`):
            The total number of training steps.
        num_cycles (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 0.5):
            The number of waves in the cosine schedule (the defaults is to just decrease from the max value to 0
            following a half-cosine).
        last_epoch (`int`, *optional*, defaults to -1):
            The index of the last epoch when resuming training.
        min_lr (`float`, *optional*):
            The minimum learning rate to reach after the cosine schedule.
        min_lr_rate (`float`, *optional*):
            The minimum learning rate as a ratio of the initial learning rate. If set, `min_lr` should not be set.
        warmup_lr_rate (`float`, *optional*):
            The minimum learning rate as a ratio of the start learning rate. If not set, `warmup_lr_rate` will be treated as float(1/num_warmup_steps).

    Return:
        `torch.optim.lr_scheduler.LambdaLR` with the appropriate schedule.
