    """Returns a canonical ordering of the nodes

    The canonical ordering of nodes (v1, ..., vn) must fulfill the following
    conditions:
    (See Lemma 1 in [2]_)

    - For the subgraph G_k of the input graph induced by v1, ..., vk it holds:
        - 2-connected
        - internally triangulated
        - the edge (v1, v2) is part of the outer face
    - For a node v(k+1) the following holds:
        - The node v(k+1) is part of the outer face of G_k
        - It has at least two neighbors in G_k
        - All neighbors of v(k+1) in G_k lie consecutively on the outer face of
          G_k (excluding the edge (v1, v2)).

    The algorithm used here starts with G_n (containing all nodes). It first
    selects the nodes v1 and v2. And then tries to find the order of the other
    nodes by checking which node can be removed in order to fulfill the
    conditions mentioned above. This is done by calculating the number of
    chords of nodes on the outer face. For more information see [1]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    embedding : nx.PlanarEmbedding
        The embedding must be triangulated
    outer_face : list
        The nodes on the outer face of the graph

    Returns
    -------
    ordering : list
        A list of tuples `(vk, wp_wq)`. Here `vk` is the node at this position
        in the canonical ordering. The element `wp_wq` is a list of nodes that
        make up the outer face of G_k.
