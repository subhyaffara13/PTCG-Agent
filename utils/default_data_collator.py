    Very simple data collator that simply collates batches of dict-like objects and performs special handling for
    potential keys named:

        - `label`: handles a single value (int or float) per object
        - `label_ids`: handles a list of values per object

    Does not do any additional preprocessing: property names of the input object will be used as corresponding inputs
    to the model. See glue and ner for example of how it's useful.
