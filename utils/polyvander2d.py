def polyvander2d(x, y, deg):
    """Pseudo-Vandermonde matrix of given degrees.

    Returns the pseudo-Vandermonde matrix of degrees `deg` and sample
    points ``(x, y)``. The pseudo-Vandermonde matrix is defined by

    .. math:: V[..., (deg[1] + 1)*i + j] = x^i * y^j,

    where ``0 <= i <= deg[0]`` and ``0 <= j <= deg[1]``. The leading indices of
    `V` index the points ``(x, y)`` and the last index encodes the powers of
    `x` and `y`.

    If ``V = polyvander2d(x, y, [xdeg, ydeg])``, then the columns of `V`
    correspond to the elements of a 2-D coefficient array `c` of shape
    (xdeg + 1, ydeg + 1) in the order

    .. math:: c_{00}, c_{01}, c_{02}, ... , c_{10}, c_{11}, c_{12}, ...

    and ``np.dot(V, c.flat)`` and ``polyval2d(x, y, c)`` will be the same
    up to roundoff. This equivalence is useful both for least squares
    fitting and for the evaluation of a large number of 2-D polynomials
    of the same degrees and sample points.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y : array_like
        Arrays of point coordinates, all of the same shape. The dtypes
        will be converted to either float64 or complex128 depending on
        whether any of the elements are complex. Scalars are converted to
        1-D arrays.
    deg : list of ints
        List of maximum degrees of the form [x_deg, y_deg].

    Returns
    -------
    vander2d : ndarray
        The shape of the returned matrix is ``x.shape + (order,)``, where
        :math:`order = (deg[0]+1)*(deg[1]+1)`.  The dtype will be the same
        as the converted `x` and `y`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np

    The 2-D pseudo-Vandermonde matrix of degree ``[1, 2]`` and sample
    points ``x = [-1, 2]`` and ``y = [1, 3]`` is as follows:

    >>> from numpy.polynomial import polynomial as P
    >>> x = np.array([-1, 2])
    >>> y = np.array([1, 3])
    >>> m, n = 1, 2
    >>> deg = np.array([m, n])
    >>> V = P.polyvander2d(x=x, y=y, deg=deg)
    >>> V
    array([[ 1.,  1.,  1., -1., -1., -1.],
           [ 1.,  3.,  9.,  2.,  6., 18.]])

    We can verify the columns for any ``0 <= i <= m`` and ``0 <= j <= n``:

    >>> i, j = 0, 1
    >>> V[:, (deg[1]+1)*i + j] == x**i * y**j
    array([ True,  True])

    The (1D) Vandermonde matrix of sample points ``x`` and degree ``m`` is a
    special case of the (2D) pseudo-Vandermonde matrix with ``y`` points all
    zero and degree ``[m, 0]``.

    >>> P.polyvander2d(x=x, y=0*x, deg=(m, 0)) == P.polyvander(x=x, deg=m)
    array([[ True,  True],
           [ True,  True]])
