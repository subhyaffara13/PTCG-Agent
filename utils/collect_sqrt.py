def collect_sqrt(expr, evaluate=None):
    """Return expr with terms having common square roots collected together.
    If ``evaluate`` is False a count indicating the number of sqrt-containing
    terms will be returned and, if non-zero, the terms of the Add will be
    returned, else the expression itself will be returned as a single term.
    If ``evaluate`` is True, the expression with any collected terms will be
    returned.

    Note: since I = sqrt(-1), it is collected, too.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import sqrt
    >>> from sympy.simplify.radsimp import collect_sqrt
    >>> from sympy.abc import a, b

    >>> r2, r3, r5 = [sqrt(i) for i in [2, 3, 5]]
    >>> collect_sqrt(a*r2 + b*r2)
    sqrt(2)*(a + b)
    >>> collect_sqrt(a*r2 + b*r2 + a*r3 + b*r3)
    sqrt(2)*(a + b) + sqrt(3)*(a + b)
    >>> collect_sqrt(a*r2 + b*r2 + a*r3 + b*r5)
    sqrt(3)*a + sqrt(5)*b + sqrt(2)*(a + b)

    If evaluate is False then the arguments will be sorted and
    returned as a list and a count of the number of sqrt-containing
    terms will be returned:

    >>> collect_sqrt(a*r2 + b*r2 + a*r3 + b*r5, evaluate=False)
    ((sqrt(3)*a, sqrt(5)*b, sqrt(2)*(a + b)), 3)
    >>> collect_sqrt(a*sqrt(2) + b, evaluate=False)
    ((b, sqrt(2)*a), 1)
    >>> collect_sqrt(a + b, evaluate=False)
    ((a + b,), 0)
