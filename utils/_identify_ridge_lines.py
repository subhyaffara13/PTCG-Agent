def _identify_ridge_lines(matr, max_distances, gap_thresh):
    """
    Identify ridges in the 2-D matrix.

    Expect that the width of the wavelet feature increases with increasing row
    number.

    Parameters
    ----------
    matr : 2-D ndarray
        Matrix in which to identify ridge lines.
    max_distances : 1-D sequence
        At each row, a ridge line is only connected
        if the relative max at row[n] is within
        `max_distances`[n] from the relative max at row[n+1].
    gap_thresh : int
        If a relative maximum is not found within `max_distances`,
        there will be a gap. A ridge line is discontinued if
        there are more than `gap_thresh` points without connecting
        a new relative maximum.

    Returns
    -------
    ridge_lines : tuple
        Tuple of 2 1-D sequences. `ridge_lines`[ii][0] are the rows of the
        ii-th ridge-line, `ridge_lines`[ii][1] are the columns. Empty if none
        found.  Each ridge-line will be sorted by row (increasing), but the
        order of the ridge lines is not specified.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from scipy.signal._peak_finding import _identify_ridge_lines
    >>> rng = np.random.default_rng()
    >>> data = rng.random((5,5))
    >>> max_dist = 3
    >>> max_distances = np.full(20, max_dist)
    >>> ridge_lines = _identify_ridge_lines(data, max_distances, 1)

    Notes
    -----
    This function is intended to be used in conjunction with `cwt`
    as part of `find_peaks_cwt`.
