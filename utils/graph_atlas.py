def graph_atlas(i):
    """Returns graph number `i` from the Graph Atlas.

    For more information, see :func:`.graph_atlas_g`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    i : int
        The index of the graph from the atlas to get. The graph at index
        0 is assumed to be the null graph.

    Returns
    -------
    list
        A list of :class:`~networkx.Graph` objects, the one at index *i*
        corresponding to the graph *i* in the Graph Atlas.

    See also
    --------
    graph_atlas_g

    Notes
    -----
    The time required by this function increases linearly with the
    argument `i`, since it reads a large file sequentially in order to
    generate the graph [1]_.
