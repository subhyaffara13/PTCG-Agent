def sdm_rref_den(A, K):
    """
    Return the reduced row echelon form (RREF) of A with denominator.

    The RREF is computed using fraction-free Gauss-Jordan elimination.

    Explanation
    ===========

    The algorithm used is the fraction-free version of Gauss-Jordan elimination
    described as FFGJ in [1]_. Here it is modified to handle zero or missing
    pivots and to avoid redundant arithmetic. This implementation is also
    optimized for sparse matrices.

    The domain $K$ must support exact division (``K.exquo``) but does not need
    to be a field. This method is suitable for most exact rings and fields like
    :ref:`ZZ`, :ref:`QQ` and :ref:`QQ(a)`. In the case of :ref:`QQ` or
    :ref:`K(x)` it might be more efficient to clear denominators and use
    :ref:`ZZ` or :ref:`K[x]` instead.

    For inexact domains like :ref:`RR` and :ref:`CC` use ``ddm_irref`` instead.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.polys.matrices.sdm import sdm_rref_den
    >>> from sympy.polys.domains import ZZ
    >>> A = {0: {0: ZZ(1), 1: ZZ(2)}, 1: {0: ZZ(3), 1: ZZ(4)}}
    >>> A_rref, den, pivots = sdm_rref_den(A, ZZ)
    >>> A_rref
    {0: {0: -2}, 1: {1: -2}}
    >>> den
    -2
    >>> pivots
    [0, 1]

    #
    # We represent each row of the matrix as a dict mapping column indices to
    # nonzero elements. We will build the RREF matrix starting from an empty
    # matrix and appending one row at a time. At each step we will have the
    # RREF of the rows we have processed so far.
    #
    # Our representation of the RREF divides it into three parts:
    #
    # 1. Fully reduced rows having only a single nonzero element (the pivot).
    # 2. Partially reduced rows having nonzeros after the pivot.
    # 3. The current denominator and divisor.
    #
    # For example if the incremental RREF might be:
    #
    #   [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    #   [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0]
    #   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    #   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0]
    #   [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0]
    #
    # Here the second row is partially reduced and the other rows are fully
    # reduced. The denominator would be 2 in this case. We distinguish the
    # fully reduced rows because we can handle them more efficiently when
    # adding a new row.
    #
    # When adding a new row we need to multiply it by the current denominator.
    # Then we reduce the new row by cross cancellation with the previous rows.
    # Then if it is not reduced to zero we take its leading entry as the new
    # pivot, cross cancel the new row from the previous rows and update the
    # denominator. In the fraction-free version this last step requires
    # multiplying and dividing the whole matrix by the new pivot and the
    # current divisor. The advantage of building the RREF one row at a time is
    # that in the sparse case we only need to work with the relatively sparse
    # upper rows of the matrix. The simple version of FFGJ in [1] would
    # multiply and divide all the dense lower rows at each step.

    # Handle the trivial cases.
