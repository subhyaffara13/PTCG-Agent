    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
        NetworkX graph object.

    x: string ('in','out')
       The degree type for source node (directed graphs only).

    y: string ('in','out')
       The degree type for target node (directed graphs only).

    weight: string or None, optional (default=None)
       The edge attribute that holds the numerical value used
       as a weight.  If None, then each edge has weight 1.
       The degree is the sum of the edge weights adjacent to the node.

    normalized : bool (default=False)
        Return counts if False or probabilities if True.

    Returns
    -------
    d: dictionary
       Counts or joint probability of occurrence of degree pairs.
