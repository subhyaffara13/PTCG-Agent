def _feasibility(node1, node2, graph_params, state_params):
    """Given a candidate pair of nodes u and v from G1 and G2 respectively,
    checks if it's feasible to extend the mapping, i.e. if u and v can be matched.

    Notes
    -----
    This function performs all the necessary checking by applying both consistency
    and cutting rules.

    Parameters
    ----------
    node1, node2: Graph node
        The candidate pair of nodes being checked for matching

    graph_params: namedtuple
        Contains all the Graph-related parameters:

        G1,G2: NetworkX Graph or MultiGraph instances.
            The two graphs to check for isomorphism or monomorphism

        G1_labels,G2_labels: dict
            The label of every node in G1 and G2 respectively

    state_params: namedtuple
        Contains all the State-related parameters:

        mapping: dict
            The mapping as extended so far. Maps nodes of G1 to nodes of G2

        reverse_mapping: dict
            The reverse mapping as extended so far. Maps nodes from G2 to nodes
            of G1. It's basically "mapping" reversed

        T1, T2: set
            Ti contains uncovered neighbors of covered nodes from Gi, i.e. nodes
            that are not in the mapping, but are neighbors of nodes that are.

        T1_out, T2_out: set
            Ti_out contains all the nodes from Gi, that are neither in the mapping
            nor in Ti

    Returns
    -------
    True if all checks are successful, False otherwise.
