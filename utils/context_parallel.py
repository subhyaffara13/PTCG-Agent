    ``context_parallel`` is an experimental API to enable context
    parallelism (CP). This API performs two actions: 1) patch the SDPA
    (``torch.nn.functional.scaled_dot_product_attention``) with the CP-enabled
    one, 2) shard ``buffers`` along the sequence dimension and each rank will
    preserve the corresponding shard according ``mesh``.

    Args:
        mesh (:class:`DeviceMesh`): the device mesh for the context parallelism.
        buffers (Optional[List[torch.Tensor]]): buffers that the usage depend
            on the sequence dimension. Examples are input batch, labels and
            positional embedding buffers. These buffers must be sharded along
            the sequence dimension to ensure the accuracy. The sharding will
            happen in-place, the buffer's shape will change within the context.
            The buffers will be restored after the context finishes.
            ``no_restore_buffers`` can be used to specify which buffers don't
            need to be restored. Note that ``buffers`` should not contain any
            nn.Parameter.
        buffer_seq_dims (Optional[List[int]]): the sequence dimensions of ``buffers``.
        no_restore_buffers (Optional[Set[torch.Tensor]]): buffers in these set
            won't be restored after the context exits. This set must be a subset
            of ``buffers``. If the buffers won't be used after the context exits,
            these buffers can be put in this list to avoid extra restore time.
