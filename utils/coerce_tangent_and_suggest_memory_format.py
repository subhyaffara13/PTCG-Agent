    # that we can not answer (and therefore have to guess) as we trace the backward ahead-of-time,
    # The same applies to any tensor subclass metadata, when we have tangents that are subclasses.
    # To handle this situation, we have two new methods that a tensor subclass can implement:
    # (1) __coerce_tangent_metadata__(self)
    #     Given a subclass with "non-standard" metadata, turn it into a new subclass with "normal" metadata.
    #     The main example here is a DTensor with the "_Partial" placement.
    #     If we have a forward output with a _Partial placement, and corresponding tangent
    #     with a Replicate/Shard placement, we have no way to convert the tangent "back" to a _Partial placement.
    #     This method lets us avoid the problem entirely by allowing subclasses to ensure that we can never
    #     have a tangent with "problematic" metadata, that we cannot convert to.
    # (1) __coerce_same_metadata_as_tangent__(self, metadata)
    #     Given a subclass, and a target differing metadata,
    #     convert self to have the same metadata as the target.
    #     With DTensor being the main example, we can use this to convert a DTensor with a Replicate()
    #     placement into one with a Shard() placement, in the case that we "guessed wrong",
    #     and traced tangents with a Shard() placement at compile time.
