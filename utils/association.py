def association(observed, method="cramer", correction=False, lambda_=None):
    """Calculates degree of association between two nominal variables.

    The function provides the option for computing one of three measures of
    association between two nominal variables from the data given in a 2d
    contingency table: Tschuprow's T, Pearson's Contingency Coefficient
    and Cramer's V.

    Parameters
    ----------
    observed : array-like
        The array of observed values
    method : {"cramer", "tschuprow", "pearson"} (default = "cramer")
        The association test statistic.
    correction : bool, optional
        Inherited from `scipy.stats.contingency.chi2_contingency()`
    lambda_ : float or str, optional
        Inherited from `scipy.stats.contingency.chi2_contingency()`

    Returns
    -------
    statistic : float
        Value of the test statistic

    Notes
    -----
    Cramer's V, Tschuprow's T and Pearson's Contingency Coefficient, all
    measure the degree to which two nominal or ordinal variables are related,
    or the level of their association. This differs from correlation, although
    many often mistakenly consider them equivalent. Correlation measures in
    what way two variables are related, whereas, association measures how
    related the variables are. As such, association does not subsume
    independent variables, and is rather a test of independence. A value of
    1.0 indicates perfect association, and 0.0 means the variables have no
    association.

    Both the Cramer's V and Tschuprow's T are extensions of the phi
    coefficient.  Moreover, due to the close relationship between the
    Cramer's V and Tschuprow's T the returned values can often be similar
    or even equivalent.  They are likely to diverge more as the array shape
    diverges from a 2x2.
