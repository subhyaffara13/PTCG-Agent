    """
    may_share_memory(a, b, /, max_work=0)

    Determine if two arrays might share memory

    A return of True does not necessarily mean that the two arrays
    share any element.  It just means that they *might*.

    Only the memory bounds of a and b are checked by default.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a, b : ndarray
        Input arrays
    max_work : int, optional
        Effort to spend on solving the overlap problem.  See
        `shares_memory` for details.  Default for ``may_share_memory``
        is to do a bounds check.

    Returns
    -------
    out : bool

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> np.may_share_memory(np.array([1,2]), np.array([5,8,9]))
    False
    >>> x = np.zeros([3, 4])
    >>> np.may_share_memory(x[:,0], x[:,1])
    True
