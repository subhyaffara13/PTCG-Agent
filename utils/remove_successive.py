    """Removes all successive entries in the dictionary in argument.

    :param all_couples: collection that has to be cleaned up from successive entries.
                        The keys are couples of indices that mark the beginning of common entries
                        in both linesets. The values have two parts. The first one is the couple
                        of starting and ending line numbers of common successive lines in the first file.
                        The second part is the same for the second file.

    For example consider the following dict:

    >>> all_couples
    {(11, 34): ([5, 9], [27, 31]),
     (23, 79): ([15, 19], [45, 49]),
     (12, 35): ([6, 10], [28, 32])}

    There are two successive keys (11, 34) and (12, 35).
    It means there are two consecutive similar chunks of lines in both files.
    Thus remove last entry and update the last line numbers in the first entry

    >>> remove_successive(all_couples)
    >>> all_couples
    {(11, 34): ([5, 10], [27, 32]),
     (23, 79): ([15, 19], [45, 49])}
