def single_source_all_shortest_paths(G, source, weight=None, method="dijkstra"):
    """Compute all shortest simple paths from the given source in the graph.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    source : node
       Starting node for path.

    weight : None, string or function, optional (default = None)
        If None, every edge has weight/distance/cost 1.
        If a string, use this edge attribute as the edge weight.
        Any edge attribute not present defaults to 1.
        If this is a function, the weight of an edge is the value
        returned by the function. The function must accept exactly
        three positional arguments: the two endpoints of an edge and
        the dictionary of edge attributes for that edge.
        The function must return a number.

    method : string, optional (default = 'dijkstra')
       The algorithm to use to compute the path lengths.
       Supported options: 'dijkstra', 'bellman-ford'.
       Other inputs produce a ValueError.
       If `weight` is None, unweighted graph methods are used, and this
       suggestion is ignored.

    Returns
    -------
    paths : generator of dictionary
        A generator of all paths between source and all nodes in the graph.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `method` is not among the supported options.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.Graph()
    >>> nx.add_path(G, [0, 1, 2, 3, 0])
    >>> dict(nx.single_source_all_shortest_paths(G, source=0))
    {0: [[0]], 1: [[0, 1]], 3: [[0, 3]], 2: [[0, 1, 2], [0, 3, 2]]}

    Notes
    -----
    There may be many shortest paths between the source and target.  If G
    contains zero-weight cycles, this function will not produce all shortest
    paths because doing so would produce infinitely many paths of unbounded
    length -- instead, we only produce the shortest simple paths.
