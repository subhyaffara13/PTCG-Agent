def geometric_edges(G, radius, p=2, *, pos_name="pos"):
    """Returns edge list of node pairs within `radius` of each other.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : networkx graph
        The graph from which to generate the edge list. The nodes in `G` should
        have an attribute ``pos`` corresponding to the node position, which is
        used to compute the distance to other nodes.
    radius : scalar
        The distance threshold. Edges are included in the edge list if the
        distance between the two nodes is less than `radius`.
    pos_name : string, default="pos"
        The name of the node attribute which represents the position of each
        node in 2D coordinates. Every node in the Graph must have this attribute.
    p : scalar, default=2
        The `Minkowski distance metric
        <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_distance>`_ used to compute
        distances. The default value is 2, i.e. Euclidean distance.

    Returns
    -------
    edges : list
        List of edges whose distances are less than `radius`

    Notes
    -----
    Radius uses Minkowski distance metric `p`.
    If scipy is available, `scipy.spatial.cKDTree` is used to speed computation.

    Examples
    --------
    Create a graph with nodes that have a "pos" attribute representing 2D
    coordinates.

    >>> G = nx.Graph()
    >>> G.add_nodes_from(
    ...     [
    ...         (0, {"pos": (0, 0)}),
    ...         (1, {"pos": (3, 0)}),
    ...         (2, {"pos": (8, 0)}),
    ...     ]
    ... )
    >>> nx.geometric_edges(G, radius=1)
    []
    >>> nx.geometric_edges(G, radius=4)
    [(0, 1)]
    >>> nx.geometric_edges(G, radius=6)
    [(0, 1), (1, 2)]
    >>> nx.geometric_edges(G, radius=9)
    [(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2)]
