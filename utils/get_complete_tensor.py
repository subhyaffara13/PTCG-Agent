) -> torch.Tensor:
    """
    Given a group of (model_name, weight_name) pairs whose tensors share the same
    underlying storage, return the complete (maximal) tensor covering that storage
    region.

    This function handles two cases:

    1. If any tensor in the group is already marked as complete, return it directly.
    2. Otherwise, all tensors in the group are assumed to be slices of a larger,
        contiguous tensor backed by the same storage. In this case, reconstruct
        the complete tensor by taking the union of their storage ranges. This assumes
        all tensors in the group have the same dtype.

    Args:
        group: Set of (model_name, weight_name) tuples identifying tensors that share storage.
        models_weights: Dictionary mapping model names to their Weights objects.

    Returns:
        The complete tensor (either found directly or reconstructed from slices).

    Example:
        # Tensors a, b, c share storage:
        # a = full_tensor[0:5]   -> start=addr_0, end=addr_5
        # b = full_tensor[3:8]   -> start=addr_3, end=addr_8
        # c = full_tensor        -> complete tensor

        # Case 1: If c is in group -> return c
        # Case 2: If only a, b in group -> reconstruct from addr_0 to addr_8
