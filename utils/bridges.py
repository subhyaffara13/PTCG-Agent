def bridges(G, root=None):
    """Generate all bridges in a graph.

    A *bridge* in a graph is an edge whose removal causes the number of
    connected components of the graph to increase.  Equivalently, a bridge is an
    edge that does not belong to any cycle. Bridges are also known as cut-edges,
    isthmuses, or cut arcs.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : undirected graph

    root : node (optional)
       A node in the graph `G`. If specified, only the bridges in the
       connected component containing this node will be returned.

    Yields
    ------
    e : edge
       An edge in the graph whose removal disconnects the graph (or
       causes the number of connected components to increase).

    Raises
    ------
    NodeNotFound
       If `root` is not in the graph `G`.

    NetworkXNotImplemented
        If `G` is a directed graph.

    Examples
    --------
    The barbell graph with parameter zero has a single bridge:

    >>> G = nx.barbell_graph(10, 0)
    >>> list(nx.bridges(G))
    [(9, 10)]

    Notes
    -----
    This is an implementation of the algorithm described in [1]_.  An edge is a
    bridge if and only if it is not contained in any chain. Chains are found
    using the :func:`networkx.chain_decomposition` function.

    The algorithm described in [1]_ requires a simple graph. If the provided
    graph is a multigraph, we convert it to a simple graph and verify that any
    bridges discovered by the chain decomposition algorithm are not multi-edges.

    Ignoring polylogarithmic factors, the worst-case time complexity is the
    same as the :func:`networkx.chain_decomposition` function,
    $O(m + n)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes in the graph and $m$ is
    the number of edges.
