def all_simple_paths(G, source, target, cutoff=None):
    """Generate all simple paths in the graph G from source to target.

    A simple path is a path with no repeated nodes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    source : node
       Starting node for path

    target : nodes
       Single node or iterable of nodes at which to end path

    cutoff : integer, optional
        Depth to stop the search. Only paths with length <= `cutoff` are returned.
        where the mathematical "length of a path" is `len(path) -1` (number of edges).

    Returns
    -------
    path_generator: generator
       A generator that produces lists of simple paths.  If there are no paths
       between the source and target within the given cutoff the generator
       produces no output. If it is possible to traverse the same sequence of
       nodes in multiple ways, namely through parallel edges, then it will be
       returned multiple times (once for each viable edge combination).

    Examples
    --------
    This iterator generates lists of nodes::

        >>> G = nx.complete_graph(4)
        >>> for path in nx.all_simple_paths(G, source=0, target=3):
        ...     print(path)
        ...
        [0, 1, 2, 3]
        [0, 1, 3]
        [0, 2, 1, 3]
        [0, 2, 3]
        [0, 3]

    You can generate only those paths that are shorter than a certain
    length by using the `cutoff` keyword argument::

        >>> paths = nx.all_simple_paths(G, source=0, target=3, cutoff=2)
        >>> print(list(paths))
        [[0, 1, 3], [0, 2, 3], [0, 3]]

    To get each path as the corresponding list of edges, you can use the
    :func:`networkx.utils.pairwise` helper function::

        >>> paths = nx.all_simple_paths(G, source=0, target=3)
        >>> for path in map(nx.utils.pairwise, paths):
        ...     print(list(path))
        [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3)]
        [(0, 1), (1, 3)]
        [(0, 2), (2, 1), (1, 3)]
        [(0, 2), (2, 3)]
        [(0, 3)]

    Pass an iterable of nodes as target to generate all paths ending in any of several nodes::

        >>> G = nx.complete_graph(4)
        >>> for path in nx.all_simple_paths(G, source=0, target=[3, 2]):
        ...     print(path)
        ...
        [0, 1, 2]
        [0, 1, 2, 3]
        [0, 1, 3]
        [0, 1, 3, 2]
        [0, 2]
        [0, 2, 1, 3]
        [0, 2, 3]
        [0, 3]
        [0, 3, 1, 2]
        [0, 3, 2]

    The singleton path from ``source`` to itself is considered a simple path and is
    included in the results:

        >>> G = nx.empty_graph(5)
        >>> list(nx.all_simple_paths(G, source=0, target=0))
        [[0]]

        >>> G = nx.path_graph(3)
        >>> list(nx.all_simple_paths(G, source=0, target={0, 1, 2}))
        [[0], [0, 1], [0, 1, 2]]

    Iterate over each path from the root nodes to the leaf nodes in a
    directed acyclic graph using a functional programming approach::

        >>> from itertools import chain
        >>> from itertools import product
        >>> from itertools import starmap
        >>> from functools import partial
        >>>
        >>> chaini = chain.from_iterable
        >>>
        >>> G = nx.DiGraph([(0, 1), (1, 2), (0, 3), (3, 2)])
        >>> roots = (v for v, d in G.in_degree() if d == 0)
        >>> leaves = (v for v, d in G.out_degree() if d == 0)
        >>> all_paths = partial(nx.all_simple_paths, G)
        >>> list(chaini(starmap(all_paths, product(roots, leaves))))
        [[0, 1, 2], [0, 3, 2]]

    The same list computed using an iterative approach::

        >>> G = nx.DiGraph([(0, 1), (1, 2), (0, 3), (3, 2)])
        >>> roots = (v for v, d in G.in_degree() if d == 0)
        >>> leaves = (v for v, d in G.out_degree() if d == 0)
        >>> all_paths = []
        >>> for root in roots:
        ...     for leaf in leaves:
        ...         paths = nx.all_simple_paths(G, root, leaf)
        ...         all_paths.extend(paths)
        >>> all_paths
        [[0, 1, 2], [0, 3, 2]]

    Iterate over each path from the root nodes to the leaf nodes in a
    directed acyclic graph passing all leaves together to avoid unnecessary
    compute::

        >>> G = nx.DiGraph([(0, 1), (2, 1), (1, 3), (1, 4)])
        >>> roots = (v for v, d in G.in_degree() if d == 0)
        >>> leaves = [v for v, d in G.out_degree() if d == 0]
        >>> all_paths = []
        >>> for root in roots:
        ...     paths = nx.all_simple_paths(G, root, leaves)
        ...     all_paths.extend(paths)
        >>> all_paths
        [[0, 1, 3], [0, 1, 4], [2, 1, 3], [2, 1, 4]]

    If parallel edges offer multiple ways to traverse a given sequence of
    nodes, this sequence of nodes will be returned multiple times:

        >>> G = nx.MultiDiGraph([(0, 1), (0, 1), (1, 2)])
        >>> list(nx.all_simple_paths(G, 0, 2))
        [[0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 2]]

    Notes
    -----
    This algorithm uses a modified depth-first search to generate the
    paths [1]_.  A single path can be found in $O(V+E)$ time but the
    number of simple paths in a graph can be very large, e.g. $O(n!)$ in
    the complete graph of order $n$.

    This function does not check that a path exists between `source` and
    `target`. For large graphs, this may result in very long runtimes.
    Consider using `has_path` to check that a path exists between `source` and
    `target` before calling this function on large graphs.
