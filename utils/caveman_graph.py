def caveman_graph(l, k):
    """Returns a caveman graph of `l` cliques of size `k`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    l : int
      Number of cliques
    k : int
      Size of cliques

    Returns
    -------
    G : NetworkX Graph
      caveman graph

    Notes
    -----
    This returns an undirected graph, it can be converted to a directed
    graph using :func:`nx.to_directed`, or a multigraph using
    ``nx.MultiGraph(nx.caveman_graph(l, k))``. Only the undirected version is
    described in [1]_ and it is unclear which of the directed
    generalizations is most useful.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.caveman_graph(3, 3)
