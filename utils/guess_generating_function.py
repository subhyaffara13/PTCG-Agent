    """
    Tries to "guess" a generating function for a sequence of rational numbers v.
    Only a few patterns are implemented yet.

    Explanation
    ===========

    The function returns a dictionary where keys are the name of a given type of
    generating function. Six types are currently implemented:

         type  |  formal definition
        -------+----------------------------------------------------------------
        ogf    | f(x) = Sum(            a_k * x^k       ,  k: 0..infinity )
        egf    | f(x) = Sum(            a_k * x^k / k!  ,  k: 0..infinity )
        lgf    | f(x) = Sum( (-1)^(k+1) a_k * x^k / k   ,  k: 1..infinity )
               |        (with initial index being hold as 1 rather than 0)
        hlgf   | f(x) = Sum(            a_k * x^k / k   ,  k: 1..infinity )
               |        (with initial index being hold as 1 rather than 0)
        lgdogf | f(x) = derivate( log(Sum( a_k * x^k, k: 0..infinity )), x)
        lgdegf | f(x) = derivate( log(Sum( a_k * x^k / k!, k: 0..infinity )), x)

    In order to spare time, the user can select only some types of generating
    functions (default being ['all']). While forgetting to use a list in the
    case of a single type may seem to work most of the time as in: types='ogf'
    this (convenient) syntax may lead to unexpected extra results in some cases.

    Discarding a type when calling the function does not mean that the type will
    not be present in the returned dictionary; it only means that no extra
    computation will be performed for that type, but the function may still add
    it in the result when it can be easily converted from another type.

    Two generating functions (lgdogf and lgdegf) are not even computed if the
    initial term of the sequence is 0; it may be useful in that case to try
    again after having removed the leading zeros.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.concrete.guess import guess_generating_function as ggf
    >>> ggf([k+1 for k in range(12)], types=['ogf', 'lgf', 'hlgf'])
    {'hlgf': 1/(1 - x), 'lgf': 1/(x + 1), 'ogf': 1/(x**2 - 2*x + 1)}

    >>> from sympy import sympify
    >>> l = sympify("[3/2, 11/2, 0, -121/2, -363/2, 121]")
    >>> ggf(l)
    {'ogf': (x + 3/2)/(11*x**2 - 3*x + 1)}

    >>> from sympy import fibonacci
    >>> ggf([fibonacci(k) for k in range(5, 15)], types=['ogf'])
    {'ogf': (3*x + 5)/(-x**2 - x + 1)}

    >>> from sympy import factorial
    >>> ggf([factorial(k) for k in range(12)], types=['ogf', 'egf', 'lgf'])
    {'egf': 1/(1 - x)}

    >>> ggf([k+1 for k in range(12)], types=['egf'])
    {'egf': (x + 1)*exp(x), 'lgdegf': (x + 2)/(x + 1)}

    N-th root of a rational function can also be detected (below is an example
    coming from the sequence A108626 from https://oeis.org).
    The greatest n-th root to be tested is specified as maxsqrtn (default 2).

    >>> ggf([1, 2, 5, 14, 41, 124, 383, 1200, 3799, 12122, 38919])['ogf']
    sqrt(1/(x**4 + 2*x**2 - 4*x + 1))
