    r"""
    Perform a goodness of fit test comparing data to a distribution family.

    Given a distribution family and data, perform a test of the null hypothesis
    that the data were drawn from a distribution in that family. Any known
    parameters of the distribution may be specified. Remaining parameters of
    the distribution will be fit to the data, and the p-value of the test
    is computed accordingly. Several statistics for comparing the distribution
    to data are available.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dist : `scipy.stats.rv_continuous`
        The object representing the distribution family under the null
        hypothesis.
    data : 1D array_like
        Finite, uncensored data to be tested.
    known_params : dict, optional
        A dictionary containing name-value pairs of known distribution
        parameters. Monte Carlo samples are randomly drawn from the
        null-hypothesized distribution with these values of the parameters.
        Before the statistic is evaluated for the observed `data` and each
        Monte Carlo sample, only remaining unknown parameters of the
        null-hypothesized distribution family are fit to the samples; the
        known parameters are held fixed. If all parameters of the distribution
        family are known, then the step of fitting the distribution family to
        each sample is omitted.
    fit_params : dict, optional
        A dictionary containing name-value pairs of distribution parameters
        that have already been fit to the data, e.g. using `scipy.stats.fit`
        or the ``fit`` method of `dist`. Monte Carlo samples are drawn from the
        null-hypothesized distribution with these specified values of the
        parameter. However, these and all other unknown parameters of the
        null-hypothesized distribution family are always fit to the sample,
        whether that is the observed `data` or a Monte Carlo sample, before
        the statistic is evaluated.
    guessed_params : dict, optional
        A dictionary containing name-value pairs of distribution parameters
        which have been guessed. These parameters are always considered as
        free parameters and are fit both to the provided `data` as well as
        to the Monte Carlo samples drawn from the null-hypothesized
        distribution. The purpose of these `guessed_params` is to be used as
        initial values for the numerical fitting procedure.
    statistic : {"ad", "ks", "cvm", "filliben"} or callable, optional
        The statistic used to compare data to a distribution after fitting
        unknown parameters of the distribution family to the data. The
        Anderson-Darling ("ad") [1]_, Kolmogorov-Smirnov ("ks") [1]_,
        Cramer-von Mises ("cvm") [1]_, and Filliben ("filliben") [7]_
        statistics are available.  Alternatively, a callable with signature
        ``(dist, data, axis)`` may be supplied to compute the statistic. Here
        ``dist`` is a frozen distribution object (potentially with array
        parameters), ``data`` is an array of Monte Carlo samples (of
        compatible shape), and ``axis`` is the axis of ``data`` along which
        the statistic must be computed.
    n_mc_samples : int, default: 9999
        The number of Monte Carlo samples drawn from the null hypothesized
        distribution to form the null distribution of the statistic. The
        sample size of each is the same as the given `data`.
    rng : `numpy.random.Generator`, optional
        Pseudorandom number generator state. When `rng` is None, a new
        `numpy.random.Generator` is created using entropy from the
        operating system. Types other than `numpy.random.Generator` are
        passed to `numpy.random.default_rng` to instantiate a ``Generator``.

    Returns
    -------
    res : GoodnessOfFitResult
        An object with the following attributes.

        fit_result : `~scipy.stats._result_classes.FitResult`
            An object representing the fit of the provided `dist` to `data`.
            This  object includes the values of distribution family parameters
            that fully define the null-hypothesized distribution, that is,
            the distribution from which Monte Carlo samples are drawn.
        statistic : float
            The value of the statistic comparing provided `data` to the
            null-hypothesized distribution.
        pvalue : float
            The proportion of elements in the null distribution with
            statistic values at least as extreme as the statistic value of the
            provided `data`.
        null_distribution : ndarray
            The value of the statistic for each Monte Carlo sample
            drawn from the null-hypothesized distribution.

    Notes
    -----
    This is a generalized Monte Carlo goodness-of-fit procedure, special cases
    of which correspond with various Anderson-Darling tests, Lilliefors' test,
    etc. The test is described in [2]_, [3]_, and [4]_ as a parametric
    bootstrap test. This is a Monte Carlo test in which parameters that
    specify the distribution from which samples are drawn have been estimated
    from the data. We describe the test using "Monte Carlo" rather than
    "parametric bootstrap" throughout to avoid confusion with the more familiar
    nonparametric bootstrap, and describe how the test is performed below.

    *Traditional goodness of fit tests*

    Traditionally, critical values corresponding with a fixed set of
    significance levels are pre-calculated using Monte Carlo methods. Users
    perform the test by calculating the value of the test statistic only for
    their observed `data` and comparing this value to tabulated critical
    values. This practice is not very flexible, as tables are not available for
    all distributions and combinations of known and unknown parameter values.
    Also, results can be inaccurate when critical values are interpolated from
    limited tabulated data to correspond with the user's sample size and
    fitted parameter values. To overcome these shortcomings, this function
    allows the user to perform the Monte Carlo trials adapted to their
    particular data.

    *Algorithmic overview*

    In brief, this routine executes the following steps:

      1. Fit unknown parameters to the given `data`, thereby forming the
         "null-hypothesized" distribution, and compute the statistic of
         this pair of data and distribution.
      2. Draw random samples from this null-hypothesized distribution.
      3. Fit the unknown parameters to each random sample.
      4. Calculate the statistic between each sample and the distribution that
         has been fit to the sample.
      5. Compare the value of the statistic corresponding with `data` from (1)
         against the values of the statistic corresponding with the random
         samples from (4). The p-value is the proportion of samples with a
         statistic value greater than or equal to the statistic of the observed
         data.

    In more detail, the steps are as follows.

    First, any unknown parameters of the distribution family specified by
    `dist` are fit to the provided `data` using maximum likelihood estimation.
    (One exception is the normal distribution with unknown location and scale:
    we use the bias-corrected standard deviation ``np.std(data, ddof=1)`` for
    the scale as recommended in [1]_.)
    These values of the parameters specify a particular member of the
    distribution family referred to as the "null-hypothesized distribution",
    that is, the distribution from which the data were sampled under the null
    hypothesis. The `statistic`, which compares data to a distribution, is
    computed between `data` and the null-hypothesized distribution.

    Next, many (specifically `n_mc_samples`) new samples, each containing the
    same number of observations as `data`, are drawn from the
    null-hypothesized distribution. All unknown parameters of the distribution
    family `dist` are fit to *each resample*, and the `statistic` is computed
    between each sample and its corresponding fitted distribution. These
    values of the statistic form the Monte Carlo null distribution (not to be
    confused with the "null-hypothesized distribution" above).

    The p-value of the test is the proportion of statistic values in the Monte
    Carlo null distribution that are at least as extreme as the statistic value
    of the provided `data`. More precisely, the p-value is given by

    .. math::

        p = \frac{b + 1}
                 {m + 1}

    where :math:`b` is the number of statistic values in the Monte Carlo null
    distribution that are greater than or equal to the statistic value
    calculated for `data`, and :math:`m` is the number of elements in the
    Monte Carlo null distribution (`n_mc_samples`). The addition of :math:`1`
    to the numerator and denominator can be thought of as including the
    value of the statistic corresponding with `data` in the null distribution,
    but a more formal explanation is given in [5]_.

    *Limitations*

    The test can be very slow for some distribution families because unknown
    parameters of the distribution family must be fit to each of the Monte
    Carlo samples, and for most distributions in SciPy, distribution fitting
    performed via numerical optimization.

    *Anti-Pattern*

    For this reason, it may be tempting
    to treat parameters of the distribution pre-fit to `data` (by the user)
    as though they were `known_params`, as specification of all parameters of
    the distribution precludes the need to fit the distribution to each Monte
    Carlo sample. (This is essentially how the original Kilmogorov-Smirnov
    test is performed.) Although such a test can provide evidence against the
    null hypothesis, the test is conservative in the sense that small p-values
    will tend to (greatly) *overestimate* the probability of making a type I
    error (that is, rejecting the null hypothesis although it is true), and the
    power of the test is low (that is, it is less likely to reject the null
    hypothesis even when the null hypothesis is false).
    This is because the Monte Carlo samples are less likely to agree with the
    null-hypothesized distribution as well as `data`. This tends to increase
    the values of the statistic recorded in the null distribution, so that a
    larger number of them exceed the value of statistic for `data`, thereby
    inflating the p-value.

    Examples
    --------
    A well-known test of the null hypothesis that data were drawn from a
    given distribution is the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test, available in SciPy
    as `scipy.stats.ks_1samp`. Suppose we wish to test whether the following
    data:

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from scipy import stats
    >>> rng = np.random.default_rng(1638083107694713882823079058616272161)
    >>> x = stats.uniform.rvs(size=75, random_state=rng)

    were sampled from a normal distribution. To perform a KS test, the
    empirical distribution function of the observed data will be compared
    against the (theoretical) cumulative distribution function of a normal
    distribution. Of course, to do this, the normal distribution under the null
    hypothesis must be fully specified. This is commonly done by first fitting
    the ``loc`` and ``scale`` parameters of the distribution to the observed
    data, then performing the test.

    >>> loc, scale = np.mean(x), np.std(x, ddof=1)
    >>> cdf = stats.norm(loc, scale).cdf
    >>> stats.ks_1samp(x, cdf)
    KstestResult(statistic=0.1119257570456813,
                 pvalue=0.2827756409939257,
                 statistic_location=0.7751845155861765,
                 statistic_sign=-1)

    An advantage of the KS-test is that the p-value - the probability of
    obtaining a value of the test statistic under the null hypothesis as
    extreme as the value obtained from the observed data - can be calculated
    exactly and efficiently. `goodness_of_fit` can only approximate these
    results.

    >>> known_params = {'loc': loc, 'scale': scale}
    >>> res = stats.goodness_of_fit(stats.norm, x, known_params=known_params,
    ...                             statistic='ks', rng=rng)
    >>> res.statistic, res.pvalue
    (0.1119257570456813, 0.2788)

    The statistic matches exactly, but the p-value is estimated by forming
    a "Monte Carlo null distribution", that is, by explicitly drawing random
    samples from `scipy.stats.norm` with the provided parameters and
    calculating the stastic for each. The fraction of these statistic values
    at least as extreme as ``res.statistic`` approximates the exact p-value
    calculated by `scipy.stats.ks_1samp`.

    However, in many cases, we would prefer to test only that the data were
    sampled from one of *any* member of the normal distribution family, not
    specifically from the normal distribution with the location and scale
    fitted to the observed sample. In this case, Lilliefors [6]_ argued that
    the KS test is far too conservative (that is, the p-value overstates
    the actual probability of rejecting a true null hypothesis) and thus lacks
    power - the ability to reject the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis
    is actually false.
    Indeed, our p-value above is approximately 0.28, which is far too large
    to reject the null hypothesis at any common significance level.

    Consider why this might be. Note that in the KS test above, the statistic
    always compares data against the CDF of a normal distribution fitted to the
    *observed data*. This tends to reduce the value of the statistic for the
    observed data, but it is "unfair" when computing the statistic for other
    samples, such as those we randomly draw to form the Monte Carlo null
    distribution. It is easy to correct for this: whenever we compute the KS
    statistic of a sample, we use the CDF of a normal distribution fitted
    to *that sample*. The null distribution in this case has not been
    calculated exactly and is tyically approximated using Monte Carlo methods
    as described above. This is where `goodness_of_fit` excels.

    >>> res = stats.goodness_of_fit(stats.norm, x, statistic='ks', rng=rng)
    >>> res.statistic, res.pvalue
    (0.1119257570456813, 0.0196)

    Indeed, this p-value is much smaller, and small enough to (correctly)
    reject the null hypothesis at common significance levels, including 5% and
    2.5%.

    However, the KS statistic is not very sensitive to all deviations from
    normality. The original advantage of the KS statistic was the ability
    to compute the null distribution theoretically, but a more sensitive
    statistic - resulting in a higher test power - can be used now that we can
    approximate the null distribution
    computationally. The Anderson-Darling statistic [1]_ tends to be more
    sensitive, and critical values of this statistic have been tabulated
    for various significance levels and sample sizes using Monte Carlo methods.

    >>> res = stats.anderson(x, 'norm', method='interpolate')
    >>> print(res.statistic)
    1.2139573337497467
    >>> print(res.pvalue)
    0.01

    Here, the observed value of the statistic exceeds the critical value
    corresponding with a 1% significance level. This tells us that the p-value
    of the observed data is 1% or less, but what is it? `goodness_of_fit` can
    estimate it directly.

    >>> res = stats.goodness_of_fit(stats.norm, x, statistic='ad', rng=rng)
    >>> res.statistic, res.pvalue
    (1.2139573337497467, 0.0034)

    A further advantage is that use of `goodness_of_fit` is not limited to
    a particular set of distributions or conditions on which parameters
    are known versus which must be estimated from data. Instead,
    `goodness_of_fit` can estimate p-values relatively quickly for any
    distribution with a sufficiently fast and reliable ``fit`` method. For
    instance, here we perform a goodness of fit test using the Cramer-von Mises
    statistic against the Rayleigh distribution with known location and unknown
    scale.

    >>> rng = np.random.default_rng()
    >>> x = stats.chi(df=2.2, loc=0, scale=2).rvs(size=1000, random_state=rng)
    >>> res = stats.goodness_of_fit(stats.rayleigh, x, statistic='cvm',
    ...                             known_params={'loc': 0}, rng=rng)

    This executes fairly quickly, but to check the reliability of the ``fit``
    method, we should inspect the fit result.

    >>> res.fit_result  # location is as specified, and scale is reasonable
      params: FitParams(loc=0.0, scale=2.1026719844231243)
     success: True
     message: 'The fit was performed successfully.'
    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  # matplotlib must be installed to plot
    >>> res.fit_result.plot()
    >>> plt.show()

    If the distribution is not fit to the observed data as well as possible,
    the test may not control the type I error rate, that is, the chance of
    rejecting the null hypothesis even when it is true.

    We should also look for extreme outliers in the null distribution that
    may be caused by unreliable fitting. These do not necessarily invalidate
    the result, but they tend to reduce the test's power.

    >>> _, ax = plt.subplots()
    >>> ax.hist(np.log10(res.null_distribution))
    >>> ax.set_xlabel("log10 of CVM statistic under the null hypothesis")
    >>> ax.set_ylabel("Frequency")
    >>> ax.set_title("Histogram of the Monte Carlo null distribution")
    >>> plt.show()

    This plot seems reassuring.

    If ``fit`` method is working reliably, and if the distribution of the test
    statistic is not particularly sensitive to the values of the fitted
    parameters, then the p-value provided by `goodness_of_fit` is expected to
    be a good approximation.
