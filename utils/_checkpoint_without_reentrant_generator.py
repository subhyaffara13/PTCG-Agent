    Args:
        fn: describes what to run in the forward pass of the model or
            part of the model. It should also know how to handle the inputs
            passed as the tuple. For example, in LSTM, if user passes
            ``(activation, hidden)``, :attr:`function` should correctly use the
            first input as ``activation`` and the second input as ``hidden``
        preserve_rng_state(bool, optional):  Omit stashing and restoring
            the RNG state during each checkpoint.
            Default: ``True``
        context_fn(Callable, optional): A callable returning a tuple of two
            context managers. The function and its recomputation will be run
            under the first and second context managers respectively.
        determinism_check(str, optional): A string specifying the determinism
            check to perform. By default it is set to ``"default"`` which
            compares the shapes, dtypes, and devices of the recomputed tensors
            against those the saved tensors. To turn off this check, specify
            ``"none"``. Currently these are the only two supported values.
            Please open an issue if you would like to see more determinism
            checks.
        debug(bool, optional): If ``True``, error messages will also include
            a trace of the operators ran during the original forward computation
            as well as the recomputation.
        early_stop(bool, optional): If ``True``, non-reentrant checkpoint stops
            recomputation as soon as it has computed all needed Tensors. Can be
            overridden globally using :func:`set_checkpoint_early_stop` context
            manager. Default: ``True``.
        *args: Arguments to pass in to the given ``function``.
        **kwargs: Keyword arguments to pass into the given ``function``.
