def is_valid_degree_sequence_havel_hakimi(deg_sequence):
    r"""Returns True if deg_sequence can be realized by a simple graph.

    The validation proceeds using the Havel-Hakimi theorem
    [havel1955]_, [hakimi1962]_, [CL1996]_.
    Worst-case run time is $O(s)$ where $s$ is the sum of the sequence.

    Parameters
    ----------
    deg_sequence : list
        A list of integers where each element specifies the degree of a node
        in a graph.

    Returns
    -------
    valid : bool
        True if deg_sequence is graphical and False if not.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.Graph([(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 2), (5, 1), (5, 4)])
    >>> sequence = (d for _, d in G.degree())
    >>> nx.is_valid_degree_sequence_havel_hakimi(sequence)
    True

    To test a non-valid sequence:
    >>> sequence_list = [d for _, d in G.degree()]
    >>> sequence_list[-1] += 1
    >>> nx.is_valid_degree_sequence_havel_hakimi(sequence_list)
    False

    Notes
    -----
    The ZZ condition says that for the sequence d if

    .. math::
        |d| >= \frac{(\max(d) + \min(d) + 1)^2}{4*\min(d)}

    then d is graphical.  This was shown in Theorem 6 in [1]_.
