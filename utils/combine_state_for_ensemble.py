    """combine_state_for_ensemble(models) -> func, params, buffers

    Prepares a list of torch.nn.Modules for ensembling with :func:`vmap`.

    Given a list of ``M`` ``nn.Modules`` of the same class, stacks all of their
    parameters and buffers together to make ``params`` and ``buffers``.
    Each parameter and buffer in the result will have an additional dimension
    of size ``M``.

    :func:`combine_state_for_ensemble` also returns ``func``, a functional
    version of one of the models in :attr:`models`. One cannot directly run
    ``func(params, buffers, *args, **kwargs)`` directly, you probably want to
    use ``vmap(func, ...)(params, buffers, *args, **kwargs)``

    Here's an example of how to ensemble over a very simple model:

    .. code-block:: python

        num_models = 5
        batch_size = 64
        in_features, out_features = 3, 3
        models = [torch.nn.Linear(in_features, out_features) for i in range(num_models)]
        data = torch.randn(batch_size, 3)

        fmodel, params, buffers = combine_state_for_ensemble(models)
        output = vmap(fmodel, (0, 0, None))(params, buffers, data)

        assert output.shape == (num_models, batch_size, out_features)

    .. warning::
        All of the modules being stacked together must be the same (except for
        the values of their parameters/buffers). For example, they should be in the
        same mode (training vs eval).

        This API is subject to change -- we're investigating better ways to
        create ensembles and would love your feedback how to improve this.
