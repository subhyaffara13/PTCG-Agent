def approx_jacobian(x, func, epsilon, *args):
    """
    Approximate the Jacobian matrix of a callable function.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        The state vector at which to compute the Jacobian matrix.
    func : callable f(x,*args)
        The vector-valued function.
    epsilon : float
        The perturbation used to determine the partial derivatives.
    args : sequence
        Additional arguments passed to func.

    Returns
    -------
    An array of dimensions ``(lenf, lenx)`` where ``lenf`` is the length
    of the outputs of `func`, and ``lenx`` is the number of elements in
    `x`.

    Notes
    -----
    The approximation is done using forward differences.
