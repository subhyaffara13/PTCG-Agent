def partial_k_edge_augmentation(G, k, avail, weight=None):
    """Finds augmentation that k-edge-connects as much of the graph as possible.

    When a k-edge-augmentation is not possible, we can still try to find a
    small set of edges that partially k-edge-connects as much of the graph as
    possible. All possible edges are generated between remaining parts.
    This minimizes the number of k-edge-connected subgraphs in the resulting
    graph and maximizes the edge connectivity between those subgraphs.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
       An undirected graph.

    k : integer
        Desired edge connectivity

    avail : dict or a set of 2 or 3 tuples
        For more details, see :func:`k_edge_augmentation`.

    weight : string
        key to use to find weights if ``avail`` is a set of 3-tuples.
        For more details, see :func:`k_edge_augmentation`.

    Yields
    ------
    edge : tuple
        Edges in the partial augmentation of G. These edges k-edge-connect any
        part of G where it is possible, and maximally connects the remaining
        parts. In other words, all edges from avail are generated except for
        those within subgraphs that have already become k-edge-connected.

    Notes
    -----
    Construct H that augments G with all edges in avail.
    Find the k-edge-subgraphs of H.
    For each k-edge-subgraph, if the number of nodes is more than k, then find
    the k-edge-augmentation of that graph and add it to the solution. Then add
    all edges in avail between k-edge subgraphs to the solution.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.path_graph((1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7))
    >>> G.add_node(8)
    >>> avail = [(1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 5), (1, 8)]
    >>> sorted(partial_k_edge_augmentation(G, k=2, avail=avail))
