def sdm_nf_buchberger_reduced(f, G, O, K):
    r"""
    Compute a reduced normal form of ``f`` with respect to ``G`` and order ``O``.

    The ground field is assumed to be ``K``, and monomials ordered according to
    ``O``.

    In contrast to weak normal forms, reduced normal forms *are* unique, but
    their computation is more expensive.

    This is the standard Buchberger algorithm for computing reduced normal forms
    with respect to *global* monomial orders [SCA, algorithm 1.6.11].

    The ``pantom`` option is not supported, so this normal form cannot be used
    as a normal form for the "extended" groebner algorithm.
