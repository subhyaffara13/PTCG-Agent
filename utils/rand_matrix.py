    """Create random matrix with dimensions ``r`` x ``c``. If ``c`` is omitted
    the matrix will be square. If ``symmetric`` is True the matrix must be
    square. If ``percent`` is less than 100 then only approximately the given
    percentage of elements will be non-zero.

    The pseudo-random number generator used to generate matrix is chosen in the
    following way.

    * If ``prng`` is supplied, it will be used as random number generator.
      It should be an instance of ``random.Random``, or at least have
      ``randint`` and ``shuffle`` methods with same signatures.
    * if ``prng`` is not supplied but ``seed`` is supplied, then new
      ``random.Random`` with given ``seed`` will be created;
    * otherwise, a new ``random.Random`` with default seed will be used.
