    r"""Compound statements (on the same line) are generally
    discouraged.

    While sometimes it's okay to put an if/for/while with a small body
    on the same line, never do this for multi-clause statements.
    Also avoid folding such long lines!

    Always use a def statement instead of an assignment statement that
    binds a lambda expression directly to a name.
