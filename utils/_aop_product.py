def _AOP_product(n):
    """for n = (m1, m2, .., mk) return the coefficients of the polynomial,
    prod(sum(x**i for i in range(nj + 1)) for nj in n); i.e. the coefficients
    of the product of AOPs (all-one polynomials) or order given in n.  The
    resulting coefficient corresponding to x**r is the number of r-length
    combinations of sum(n) elements with multiplicities given in n.
    The coefficients are given as a default dictionary (so if a query is made
    for a key that is not present, 0 will be returned).

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.functions.combinatorial.numbers import _AOP_product
    >>> from sympy.abc import x
    >>> n = (2, 2, 3)  # e.g. aabbccc
    >>> prod = ((x**2 + x + 1)*(x**2 + x + 1)*(x**3 + x**2 + x + 1)).expand()
    >>> c = _AOP_product(n); dict(c)
    {0: 1, 1: 3, 2: 6, 3: 8, 4: 8, 5: 6, 6: 3, 7: 1}
    >>> [c[i] for i in range(8)] == [prod.coeff(x, i) for i in range(8)]
    True

    The generating poly used here is the same as that listed in
    https://tinyurl.com/cep849r, but in a refactored form.
