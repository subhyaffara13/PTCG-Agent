    # This test is part of a bugfix for gh-13703. It attempts to
    # to stress the system memory allocator, to cause it to move the
    # stream buffer and either let the OS reclaim the region, or let
    # other memory requests of parser otherwise modify the contents
    # of memory space, where it was formally located.
    # This test is designed to cause a `segfault` with unpatched
    # `tokenizer.c`. Sometimes the test fails on `segfault`, other
    # times it fails due to memory corruption, which causes the
    # loaded DataFrame to differ from the expected one.

    # Also force 'utf-8' encoding, so that `_string_convert` would take
    # a different execution branch.
