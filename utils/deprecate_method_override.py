    """
    Return ``obj.method`` with a deprecation if it was overridden, else None.

    Parameters
    ----------
    method
        An unbound method, i.e. an expression of the form
        ``Class.method_name``.  Remember that within the body of a method, one
        can always use ``__class__`` to refer to the class that is currently
        being defined.
    obj
        Either an object of the class where *method* is defined, or a subclass
        of that class.
    allow_empty : bool, default: False
        Whether to allow overrides by "empty" methods without emitting a
        warning.
    **kwargs
        Additional parameters passed to `warn_deprecated` to generate the
        deprecation warning; must at least include the "since" key.
