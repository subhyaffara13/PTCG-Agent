def pts_to_poststep(x, *args):
    """
    Convert continuous line to post-steps.

    Given a set of ``N`` points convert to ``2N + 1`` points, which when
    connected linearly give a step function which changes values at the end of
    the intervals.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array
        The x location of the steps. May be empty.

    y1, ..., yp : array
        y arrays to be turned into steps; all must be the same length as ``x``.

    Returns
    -------
    array
        The x and y values converted to steps in the same order as the input;
        can be unpacked as ``x_out, y1_out, ..., yp_out``.  If the input is
        length ``N``, each of these arrays will be length ``2N + 1``. For
        ``N=0``, the length will be 0.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> x_s, y1_s, y2_s = pts_to_poststep(x, y1, y2)
    """
