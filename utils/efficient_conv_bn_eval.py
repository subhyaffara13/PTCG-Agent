    Implementation based on https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11624
    "Efficient ConvBN Blocks for Transfer Learning and Beyond"
    It leverages the associative law between convolution and affine transform,
    i.e., normalize (weight conv feature) = (normalize weight) conv feature.
    It works for Eval mode of ConvBN blocks during validation, and can be used
    for **training** as well, but only if one sets `bn.training=False`. It
     reduces memory footprint and computation cost, at the cost of slightly
     reduced numerical stability.
    Args:
        bn (nn.modules.batchnorm._BatchNorm): a BatchNorm module.
        conv (nn.modules.conv._ConvNd): a conv module
        x (torch.Tensor): Input feature map.
