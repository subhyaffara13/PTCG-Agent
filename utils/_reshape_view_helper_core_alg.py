    # NOTE [Reshape Algorithm]
    # This algorithm works by attempting to greedily construct the desired dimensions in
    # the output shape, left to right. It does this by, conceptually, accumulating
    # dimensions of the original tensor, also left to right, until the dimension
    # can be constructed using prims.split_dim.
    # The algorithm also has special handling for tail squeezes/unsqueezes, like
    # if a reshape from (5, 5) to (5, 5, 1) or vice versa.
    #
    # This algorithm does not flatten the original tensor and then split dims as appropriate
    # because that would create copies more often than this algorithm. flatten is the only
    # operation below which can create a view or a copy, and while it prefers creating
    # views it may sometimes create a copy if the tensor's strides do not permit a view.
    # As a result, this algorithm tries to minimize flattening.
    #
    # Note that a better version of this algorithm may exist. Regions which could be
    # flattened without creating a copy can be identified in advance, and that might
    # allow fewer flatten calls or faster short-circuiting to make a copy.
