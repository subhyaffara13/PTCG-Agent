def johnson(G, weight="weight"):
    r"""Uses Johnson's Algorithm to compute shortest paths.

    Johnson's Algorithm finds a shortest path between each pair of
    nodes in a weighted graph even if negative weights are present.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    weight : string or function
        If this is a string, then edge weights will be accessed via the
        edge attribute with this key (that is, the weight of the edge
        joining `u` to `v` will be ``G.edges[u, v][weight]``). If no
        such edge attribute exists, the weight of the edge is assumed to
        be one.

        If this is a function, the weight of an edge is the value
        returned by the function. The function must accept exactly three
        positional arguments: the two endpoints of an edge and the
        dictionary of edge attributes for that edge. The function must
        return a number.

    Returns
    -------
    distance : dictionary
        Dictionary, keyed by source and target, of shortest paths.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> graph = nx.DiGraph()
    >>> graph.add_weighted_edges_from(
    ...     [("0", "3", 3), ("0", "1", -5), ("0", "2", 2), ("1", "2", 4), ("2", "3", 1)]
    ... )
    >>> paths = nx.johnson(graph, weight="weight")
    >>> paths["0"]["2"]
    ['0', '1', '2']

    Notes
    -----
    Johnson's algorithm is suitable even for graphs with negative weights. It
    works by using the Bellman–Ford algorithm to compute a transformation of
    the input graph that removes all negative weights, allowing Dijkstra's
    algorithm to be used on the transformed graph.

    The time complexity of this algorithm is $O(n^2 \log n + n m)$,
    where $n$ is the number of nodes and $m$ the number of edges in the
    graph. For dense graphs, this may be faster than the Floyd–Warshall
    algorithm.
