def _per(M):
    """Returns the permanent of a matrix. Unlike determinant,
    permanent is defined for both square and non-square matrices.

    For an m x n matrix, with m less than or equal to n,
    it is given as the sum over the permutations s of size
    less than or equal to m on [1, 2, . . . n] of the product
    from i = 1 to m of M[i, s[i]]. Taking the transpose will
    not affect the value of the permanent.

    In the case of a square matrix, this is the same as the permutation
    definition of the determinant, but it does not take the sign of the
    permutation into account. Computing the permanent with this definition
    is quite inefficient, so here the Ryser formula is used.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import Matrix
    >>> M = Matrix([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
    >>> M.per()
    450
    >>> M = Matrix([1, 5, 7])
    >>> M.per()
    13
