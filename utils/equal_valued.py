def equal_valued(x, y):
    """Compare expressions treating plain floats as rationals.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import S, symbols, Rational, Float
    >>> from sympy.core.numbers import equal_valued
    >>> equal_valued(1, 2)
    False
    >>> equal_valued(1, 1)
    True

    In SymPy expressions with Floats compare unequal to corresponding
    expressions with rationals:

    >>> x = symbols('x')
    >>> x**2 == x**2.0
    False

    However an individual Float compares equal to a Rational:

    >>> Rational(1, 2) == Float(0.5)
    False

    In a future version of SymPy this might change so that Rational and Float
    compare unequal. This function provides the behavior currently expected of
    ``==`` so that it could still be used if the behavior of ``==`` were to
    change in future.

    >>> equal_valued(1, 1.0) # Float vs Rational
    True
    >>> equal_valued(S(1).n(3), S(1).n(5)) # Floats of different precision
    True

    Explanation
    ===========

    In future SymPy versions Float and Rational might compare unequal and floats
    with different precisions might compare unequal. In that context a function
    is needed that can check if a number is equal to 1 or 0 etc. The idea is
    that instead of testing ``if x == 1:`` if we want to accept floats like
    ``1.0`` as well then the test can be written as ``if equal_valued(x, 1):``
    or ``if equal_valued(x, 2):``. Since this function is intended to be used
    in situations where one or both operands are expected to be concrete
    numbers like 1 or 0 the function does not recurse through the args of any
    compound expression to compare any nested floats.
