    r"""Perform the in-projection step of the attention operation.

    This is simply a triple of linear projections,
    with shape constraints on the weights which
    ensure embedding dimension uniformity in the projected outputs.
    Output is a triple containing projection tensors for query, key and value.

    Args:
        q, k, v: query, key and value tensors to be projected.
        w_q, w_k, w_v: weights for q, k and v, respectively.
        b_q, b_k, b_v: optional biases for q, k and v, respectively.

    Shape:
        Inputs:
        - q: :math:`(Qdims..., Eq)` where Eq is the query embedding dimension and Qdims are any
            number of leading dimensions.
        - k: :math:`(Kdims..., Ek)` where Ek is the key embedding dimension and Kdims are any
            number of leading dimensions.
        - v: :math:`(Vdims..., Ev)` where Ev is the value embedding dimension and Vdims are any
            number of leading dimensions.
        - w_q: :math:`(Eq, Eq)`
        - w_k: :math:`(Eq, Ek)`
        - w_v: :math:`(Eq, Ev)`
