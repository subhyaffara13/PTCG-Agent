    Like contextlib.ContextDecorator.

    But with the following differences:
    1. Is done by wrapping, rather than inheritance, so it works with context
       managers that are implemented from C and thus cannot easily inherit from
       Python classes
    2. Wraps generators in the intuitive way (c.f. https://bugs.python.org/issue37743)
    3. Errors out if you try to wrap a class, because it is ambiguous whether
       or not you intended to wrap only the constructor

    The input argument can either be a context manager (in which case it must
    be a multi-shot context manager that can be directly invoked multiple times)
    or a callable that produces a context manager.
