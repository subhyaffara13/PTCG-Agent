    """Find the intersection between segment (or line) and spherical constraints.

    Find the intersection between the segment (or line) defined by the
    parametric  equation ``x(t) = z + t*d`` and the ball
    ``||x|| <= trust_radius``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    z : array_like, shape (n,)
        Initial point.
    d : array_like, shape (n,)
        Direction.
    trust_radius : float
        Ball radius.
    entire_line : bool, optional
        When ``True``, the function returns the intersection between the line
        ``x(t) = z + t*d`` (``t`` can assume any value) and the ball
        ``||x|| <= trust_radius``. When ``False``, the function returns the intersection
        between the segment ``x(t) = z + t*d``, ``0 <= t <= 1``, and the ball.

    Returns
    -------
    ta, tb : float
        The line/segment ``x(t) = z + t*d`` is inside the ball for
        for ``ta <= t <= tb``.
    intersect : bool
        When ``True``, there is an intersection between the line/segment
        and the sphere. On the other hand, when ``False``, there is no
        intersection.
