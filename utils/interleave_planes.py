    Interleave (colour) planes, e.g. RGB + A = RGBA.

    Return an array of pixels consisting of the `ipsize` elements of data
    from each pixel in `ipixels` followed by the `apsize` elements of data
    from each pixel in `apixels`.  Conventionally `ipixels` and
    `apixels` are byte arrays so the sizes are bytes, but it actually
    works with any arrays of the same type.  The returned array is the
    same type as the input arrays which should be the same type as each other.
