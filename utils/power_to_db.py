    """
    Converts a power spectrogram to the decibel scale. This computes `10 * log10(spectrogram / reference)`, using basic
    logarithm properties for numerical stability.

    The motivation behind applying the log function on the (mel) spectrogram is that humans do not hear loudness on a
    linear scale. Generally to double the perceived volume of a sound we need to put 8 times as much energy into it.
    This means that large variations in energy may not sound all that different if the sound is loud to begin with.
    This compression operation makes the (mel) spectrogram features match more closely what humans actually hear.

    Based on the implementation of `librosa.power_to_db`.

    Args:
        spectrogram (`np.ndarray`):
            The input power (mel) spectrogram. Note that a power spectrogram has the amplitudes squared!
        reference (`float`, *optional*, defaults to 1.0):
            Sets the input spectrogram value that corresponds to 0 dB. For example, use `np.max(spectrogram)` to set
            the loudest part to 0 dB. Must be greater than zero.
        min_value (`float`, *optional*, defaults to `1e-10`):
            The spectrogram will be clipped to this minimum value before conversion to decibels, to avoid taking
            `log(0)`. The default of `1e-10` corresponds to a minimum of -100 dB. Must be greater than zero.
        db_range (`float`, *optional*):
            Sets the maximum dynamic range in decibels. For example, if `db_range = 80`, the difference between the
            peak value and the smallest value will never be more than 80 dB. Must be greater than zero.

    Returns:
        `np.ndarray`: the spectrogram in decibels
