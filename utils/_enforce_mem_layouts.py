    Enforce memory layouts for query, key, and value tensors.

    For non-FP8 dtypes, no action is taken.

    For FP8 dtypes, we enforce the following memory layouts:
    - Query tensor must be in row-major memory layout, as it will be the left-operand in the FP8 GEMM `q @ k.T`.
    - Key tensor must be in row-major memory layout, as it will be transposed when used as the right-operand
      in the FP8 GEMM `q @ k.T`, meaning it will correctly be in column-major memory layout for the GEMM.
    - Value tensor must be in column-major memory layout, as it will be the right-operand in the FP8 GEMM `softmax_scores @ v`.

    Returns the query, key, and value tensors with the enforced memory layouts.
