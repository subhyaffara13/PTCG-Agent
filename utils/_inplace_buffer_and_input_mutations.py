    """Transform buffer and input mutations from their functionalized form
    into copy_ nodes in the graph.

    Functionalization represents a buffer mutation by passing the buffer as
    an input and output. For example, consider the eager code:
        def forward(self, x):
            self.buffer += x
            return x * x

    This corresponds to a graph that looks like:
        def forward(self, buffer, x):
            mutated_buffer = aten.add(buffer, x)
            mul = aten.mul(x, x)
            return (mutated_buffer, mul)

    We want to inplace this into something that looks like the original
    eager code:
        def forward(self, buffer, x):
            mutated_buffer = aten.add(buffer, x)
            buffer.copy_(mutated_buffer)
            mul = aten.mul(x, x)
            return (mul,)

    Input mutations are handled similarly.
