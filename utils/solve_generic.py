def solve_generic(polys, opt, strict=False):
    """
    Solve a generic system of polynomial equations.

    Returns all possible solutions over C[x_1, x_2, ..., x_m] of a
    set F = { f_1, f_2, ..., f_n } of polynomial equations, using
    Groebner basis approach. For now only zero-dimensional systems
    are supported, which means F can have at most a finite number
    of solutions. If the basis contains only the ground, None is
    returned.

    The algorithm works by the fact that, supposing G is the basis
    of F with respect to an elimination order (here lexicographic
    order is used), G and F generate the same ideal, they have the
    same set of solutions. By the elimination property, if G is a
    reduced, zero-dimensional Groebner basis, then there exists an
    univariate polynomial in G (in its last variable). This can be
    solved by computing its roots. Substituting all computed roots
    for the last (eliminated) variable in other elements of G, new
    polynomial system is generated. Applying the above procedure
    recursively, a finite number of solutions can be found.

    The ability of finding all solutions by this procedure depends
    on the root finding algorithms. If no solutions were found, it
    means only that roots() failed, but the system is solvable. To
    overcome this difficulty use numerical algorithms instead.

    Parameters
    ==========

    polys: a list/tuple/set
        Listing all the polynomial equations that are needed to be solved
    opt: an Options object
        For specifying keyword arguments and generators
    strict: a boolean
        If strict is True, NotImplementedError will be raised if the solution
        is known to be incomplete

    Returns
    =======

    List[Tuple]
        a list of tuples with elements being solutions for the
        symbols in the order they were passed as gens
    None
        None is returned when the computed basis contains only the ground.

    Raises
    ========

    NotImplementedError
        If the system is not zero-dimensional (does not have a finite
        number of solutions)

    UnsolvableFactorError
        If ``strict`` is True and not all solution components are
        expressible in radicals
