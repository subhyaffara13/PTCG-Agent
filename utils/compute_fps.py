    """
    Computes the formula for Formal Power Series of a function.

    Explanation
    ===========

    Tries to compute the formula by applying the following techniques
    (in order):

    * rational_algorithm
    * Hypergeometric algorithm

    Parameters
    ==========

    x : Symbol
    x0 : number, optional
        Point to perform series expansion about. Default is 0.
    dir : {1, -1, '+', '-'}, optional
        If dir is 1 or '+' the series is calculated from the right and
        for -1 or '-' the series is calculated from the left. For smooth
        functions this flag will not alter the results. Default is 1.
    hyper : {True, False}, optional
        Set hyper to False to skip the hypergeometric algorithm.
        By default it is set to False.
    order : int, optional
        Order of the derivative of ``f``, Default is 4.
    rational : {True, False}, optional
        Set rational to False to skip rational algorithm. By default it is set
        to True.
    full : {True, False}, optional
        Set full to True to increase the range of rational algorithm.
        See :func:`rational_algorithm` for details. By default it is set to
        False.

    Returns
    =======

    ak : sequence
        Sequence of coefficients.
    xk : sequence
        Sequence of powers of x.
    ind : Expr
        Independent terms.
    mul : Pow
        Common terms.
