    Filter out candidates whose hashes aren't allowed, and return a new
    list of candidates.

    If at least one candidate has an allowed hash, then all candidates with
    either an allowed hash or no hash specified are returned.  Otherwise,
    the given candidates are returned.

    Including the candidates with no hash specified when there is a match
    allows a warning to be logged if there is a more preferred candidate
    with no hash specified.  Returning all candidates in the case of no
    matches lets pip report the hash of the candidate that would otherwise
    have been installed (e.g. permitting the user to more easily update
    their requirements file with the desired hash).
