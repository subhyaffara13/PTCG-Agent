def graph_certificate(gr):
    """
    Return a certificate for the graph

    Parameters
    ==========

    gr : adjacency list

    Explanation
    ===========

    The graph is assumed to be unoriented and without
    external lines.

    Associate to each vertex of the graph a symmetric tensor with
    number of indices equal to the degree of the vertex; indices
    are contracted when they correspond to the same line of the graph.
    The canonical form of the tensor gives a certificate for the graph.

    This is not an efficient algorithm to get the certificate of a graph.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.combinatorics.testutil import graph_certificate
    >>> gr1 = {0:[1, 2, 3, 5], 1:[0, 2, 4], 2:[0, 1, 3, 4], 3:[0, 2, 4], 4:[1, 2, 3, 5], 5:[0, 4]}
    >>> gr2 = {0:[1, 5], 1:[0, 2, 3, 4], 2:[1, 3, 5], 3:[1, 2, 4, 5], 4:[1, 3, 5], 5:[0, 2, 3, 4]}
    >>> c1 = graph_certificate(gr1)
    >>> c2 = graph_certificate(gr2)
    >>> c1
