def automain(module, *, args=(), kwargs=None):
    '''
    This decorator automatically invokes a function if the module is being run
    as the "__main__" module. Optionally, provide args or kwargs with which to
    call the function. If `module` is "__main__", the function is called, and
    the program is `sys.exit`ed with the return value. You can also pass `True`
    to cause the function to be called unconditionally. If the function is not
    called, it is returned unchanged by the decorator.

    Usage:

    @automain(__name__)  # Pass __name__ to check __name__=="__main__"
    def main():
        ...

    If __name__ is "__main__" here, the main function is called, and then
    sys.exit called with the return value.

    # Check that @automain(...) was called, rather than @automain
    if callable(module):
        raise AutomainRequiresModuleError(module)

    if module == '__main__' or module is True:
        if kwargs is None:
            kwargs = {}
