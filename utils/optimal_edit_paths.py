    """Returns all minimum-cost edit paths transforming G1 to G2.

    Graph edit path is a sequence of node and edge edit operations
    transforming graph G1 to graph isomorphic to G2.  Edit operations
    include substitutions, deletions, and insertions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G1, G2: graphs
        The two graphs G1 and G2 must be of the same type.

    node_match : callable
        A function that returns True if node n1 in G1 and n2 in G2
        should be considered equal during matching.

        The function will be called like

           node_match(G1.nodes[n1], G2.nodes[n2]).

        That is, the function will receive the node attribute
        dictionaries for n1 and n2 as inputs.

        Ignored if node_subst_cost is specified.  If neither
        node_match nor node_subst_cost are specified then node
        attributes are not considered.

    edge_match : callable
        A function that returns True if the edge attribute dictionaries
        for the pair of nodes (u1, v1) in G1 and (u2, v2) in G2 should
        be considered equal during matching.

        The function will be called like

           edge_match(G1[u1][v1], G2[u2][v2]).

        That is, the function will receive the edge attribute
        dictionaries of the edges under consideration.

        Ignored if edge_subst_cost is specified.  If neither
        edge_match nor edge_subst_cost are specified then edge
        attributes are not considered.

    node_subst_cost, node_del_cost, node_ins_cost : callable
        Functions that return the costs of node substitution, node
        deletion, and node insertion, respectively.

        The functions will be called like

           node_subst_cost(G1.nodes[n1], G2.nodes[n2]),
           node_del_cost(G1.nodes[n1]),
           node_ins_cost(G2.nodes[n2]).

        That is, the functions will receive the node attribute
        dictionaries as inputs.  The functions are expected to return
        positive numeric values.

        Function node_subst_cost overrides node_match if specified.
        If neither node_match nor node_subst_cost are specified then
        default node substitution cost of 0 is used (node attributes
        are not considered during matching).

        If node_del_cost is not specified then default node deletion
        cost of 1 is used.  If node_ins_cost is not specified then
        default node insertion cost of 1 is used.

    edge_subst_cost, edge_del_cost, edge_ins_cost : callable
        Functions that return the costs of edge substitution, edge
        deletion, and edge insertion, respectively.

        The functions will be called like

           edge_subst_cost(G1[u1][v1], G2[u2][v2]),
           edge_del_cost(G1[u1][v1]),
           edge_ins_cost(G2[u2][v2]).

        That is, the functions will receive the edge attribute
        dictionaries as inputs.  The functions are expected to return
        positive numeric values.

        Function edge_subst_cost overrides edge_match if specified.
        If neither edge_match nor edge_subst_cost are specified then
        default edge substitution cost of 0 is used (edge attributes
        are not considered during matching).

        If edge_del_cost is not specified then default edge deletion
        cost of 1 is used.  If edge_ins_cost is not specified then
        default edge insertion cost of 1 is used.

    upper_bound : numeric
        Maximum edit distance to consider.

    Returns
    -------
    edit_paths : list of tuples (node_edit_path, edge_edit_path)
       - node_edit_path : list of tuples ``(u, v)`` indicating node transformations
         between `G1` and `G2`. ``u`` is `None` for insertion, ``v`` is `None`
         for deletion.
       - edge_edit_path : list of tuples ``((u1, v1), (u2, v2))`` indicating edge
         transformations between `G1` and `G2`. ``(None, (u2,v2))`` for insertion
         and ``((u1,v1), None)`` for deletion.

    cost : numeric
        Optimal edit path cost (graph edit distance). When the cost
        is zero, it indicates that `G1` and `G2` are isomorphic.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G1 = nx.cycle_graph(4)
    >>> G2 = nx.wheel_graph(5)
    >>> paths, cost = nx.optimal_edit_paths(G1, G2)
    >>> len(paths)
    40
    >>> cost
    5.0

    Notes
    -----
    To transform `G1` into a graph isomorphic to `G2`, apply the node
    and edge edits in the returned ``edit_paths``.
    In the case of isomorphic graphs, the cost is zero, and the paths
    represent different isomorphic mappings (isomorphisms). That is, the
    edits involve renaming nodes and edges to match the structure of `G2`.
