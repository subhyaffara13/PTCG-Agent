def rename_parameter(since, old, new, func=None):
    """
    Decorator indicating that parameter *old* of *func* is renamed to *new*.

    The actual implementation of *func* should use *new*, not *old*.  If *old*
    is passed to *func*, a DeprecationWarning is emitted, and its value is
    used, even if *new* is also passed by keyword (this is to simplify pyplot
    wrapper functions, which always pass *new* explicitly to the Axes method).
    If *new* is also passed but positionally, a TypeError will be raised by the
    underlying function during argument binding.

    Examples
