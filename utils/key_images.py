    The return tuple is a pygame.Surface and a dictionary keyed by key name and valued by a pygame.Rect.

    This function encapsulates the constants relevant to the keyboard image
    file. There are five key types. One is the black key. The other four
    white keys are determined by the proximity of the black keys. The plain
    white key has no black key adjacent to it. A white-left and white-right
    key has a black key to the left or right of it respectively. A white-center
    key has a black key on both sides. A key may have up to six related
    images depending on the state of adjacent keys to its right.
