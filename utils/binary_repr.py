def binary_repr(num, width=None):
    """
    Return the binary representation of the input number as a string.

    For negative numbers, if width is not given, a minus sign is added to the
    front. If width is given, the two's complement of the number is
    returned, with respect to that width.

    In a two's-complement system negative numbers are represented by the two's
    complement of the absolute value. This is the most common method of
    representing signed integers on computers [1]_. An N-bit two's-complement
    system can represent every integer in the range
    :math:`-2^{N-1}` to :math:`+2^{N-1}-1`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    num : int
        Only an integer decimal number can be used.
    width : int, optional
        The length of the returned string if `num` is positive, or the length
        of the two's complement if `num` is negative, provided that `width` is
        at least a sufficient number of bits for `num` to be represented in
        the designated form. If the `width` value is insufficient, an error is
        raised.

    Returns
    -------
    bin : str
        Binary representation of `num` or two's complement of `num`.

    See Also
    --------
    base_repr: Return a string representation of a number in the given base
               system.
    bin: Python's built-in binary representation generator of an integer.

    Notes
    -----
    `binary_repr` is equivalent to using `base_repr` with base 2, but about 25x
    faster.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> np.binary_repr(3)
    '11'
    >>> np.binary_repr(-3)
    '-11'
    >>> np.binary_repr(3, width=4)
    '0011'

    The two's complement is returned when the input number is negative and
    width is specified:

    >>> np.binary_repr(-3, width=3)
    '101'
    >>> np.binary_repr(-3, width=5)
    '11101'
