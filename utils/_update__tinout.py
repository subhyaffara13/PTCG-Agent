def _update_Tinout(new_node1, new_node2, graph_params, state_params):
    """Updates the Ti/Ti_out (i=1,2) when a new node pair u-v is added to the mapping.

    Notes
    -----
    This function should be called right after the feasibility checks are passed,
    and node1 is mapped to node2. The purpose of this function is to avoid brute
    force computing of Ti/Ti_out by iterating over all nodes of the graph and
    checking which nodes satisfy the necessary conditions. Instead, in every step
    of the algorithm we focus exclusively on the two nodes that are being added
    to the mapping, incrementally updating Ti/Ti_out.

    Parameters
    ----------
    new_node1, new_node2: Graph node
        The two new nodes, added to the mapping.

    graph_params: namedtuple
        Contains all the Graph-related parameters:

        G1,G2: NetworkX Graph or MultiGraph instances.
            The two graphs to check for isomorphism or monomorphism

        G1_labels,G2_labels: dict
            The label of every node in G1 and G2 respectively

    state_params: namedtuple
        Contains all the State-related parameters:

        mapping: dict
            The mapping as extended so far. Maps nodes of G1 to nodes of G2

        reverse_mapping: dict
            The reverse mapping as extended so far. Maps nodes from G2 to nodes of G1.
            It's basically "mapping" reversed

        T1, T2: set
            Ti contains uncovered neighbors of covered nodes from Gi, i.e. nodes
            that are not in the mapping, but are neighbors of nodes that are.

        T1_tilde, T2_tilde: set
            Ti_out contains all the nodes from Gi, that are neither in the mapping nor in Ti
