    """Parses some Python code as a module and extracts a designated AST node.

    Statements:
     To extract one or more statement nodes, append #@ to the end of the line

     Examples:
       >>> def x():
       >>>   def y():
       >>>     return 1 #@

       The return statement will be extracted.

       >>> class X(object):
       >>>   def meth(self): #@
       >>>     pass

      The function object 'meth' will be extracted.

    Expressions:
     To extract arbitrary expressions, surround them with the fake
     function call __(...). After parsing, the surrounded expression
     will be returned and the whole AST (accessible via the returned
     node's parent attribute) will look like the function call was
     never there in the first place.

     Examples:
       >>> a = __(1)

       The const node will be extracted.

       >>> def x(d=__(foo.bar)): pass

       The node containing the default argument will be extracted.

       >>> def foo(a, b):
       >>>   return 0 < __(len(a)) < b

       The node containing the function call 'len' will be extracted.

    If no statements or expressions are selected, the last toplevel
    statement will be returned.

    If the selected statement is a discard statement, (i.e. an expression
    turned into a statement), the wrapped expression is returned instead.

    For convenience, singleton lists are unpacked.

    :param str code: A piece of Python code that is parsed as
    a module. Will be passed through textwrap.dedent first.
    :param str module_name: The name of the module.
    :returns: The designated node from the parse tree, or a list of nodes.
