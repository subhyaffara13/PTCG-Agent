    .. warning::
        This function is internal-only and should only be used by the ONNX
        exporter. If you are trying to get a graph through tracing, please go
        through the public API instead::

            trace = torch.jit.trace(nn.LSTMCell(), (input, hidden))
            trace_graph = trace.graph

    Trace a function or model, returning a tuple consisting of the both the
    *trace* of an execution, as well as the original return value. If return_inputs,
    also returns the trace inputs as part of the tuple

    Tracing is guaranteed not to change the semantics of the function/module
    that is traced.

    Args:
        f (torch.nn.Module or function): the function or module
            to be traced.
        args (tuple or Tensor): the positional arguments to pass to the
            function/module to be traced.  A non-tuple is assumed to
            be a single positional argument to be passed to the model.
        kwargs (dict): the keyword arguments to pass to the function/module
            to be traced.

    Example (trace a cell):

    .. testcode::

        trace = torch.jit.trace(nn.LSTMCell(), (input, hidden))
    """
