def traveling_salesman_problem(
    G, weight="weight", nodes=None, cycle=True, method=None, **kwargs
):
    """Find the shortest path in `G` connecting specified nodes

    This function allows approximate solution to the traveling salesman
    problem on networks that are not complete graphs and/or where the
    salesman does not need to visit all nodes.

    This function proceeds in two steps. First, it creates a complete
    graph using the all-pairs shortest_paths between nodes in `nodes`.
    Edge weights in the new graph are the lengths of the paths
    between each pair of nodes in the original graph.
    Second, an algorithm (default: `christofides` for undirected and
    `asadpour_atsp` for directed) is used to approximate the minimal Hamiltonian
    cycle on this new graph. The available algorithms are:

     - christofides
     - greedy_tsp
     - simulated_annealing_tsp
     - threshold_accepting_tsp
     - asadpour_atsp

    Once the Hamiltonian Cycle is found, this function post-processes to
    accommodate the structure of the original graph. If `cycle` is ``False``,
    the biggest weight edge is removed to make a Hamiltonian path.
    Then each edge on the new complete graph used for that analysis is
    replaced by the shortest_path between those nodes on the original graph.
    If the input graph `G` includes edges with weights that do not adhere to
    the triangle inequality, such as when `G` is not a complete graph (i.e
    length of non-existent edges is infinity), then the returned path may
    contain some repeating nodes (other than the starting node).

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
        A possibly weighted graph

    nodes : collection of nodes (default=G.nodes)
        collection (list, set, etc.) of nodes to visit

    weight : string, optional (default="weight")
        Edge data key corresponding to the edge weight.
        If any edge does not have this attribute the weight is set to 1.

    cycle : bool (default: True)
        Indicates whether a cycle should be returned, or a path.
        Note: the cycle is the approximate minimal cycle.
        The path simply removes the biggest edge in that cycle.

    method : function (default: None)
        A function that returns a cycle on all nodes and approximates
        the solution to the traveling salesman problem on a complete
        graph. The returned cycle is then used to find a corresponding
        solution on `G`. `method` should be callable; take inputs
        `G`, and `weight`; and return a list of nodes along the cycle.

        Provided options include :func:`christofides`, :func:`greedy_tsp`,
        :func:`simulated_annealing_tsp` and :func:`threshold_accepting_tsp`.

        If `method is None`: use :func:`christofides` for undirected `G` and
        :func:`asadpour_atsp` for directed `G`.

    **kwargs : dict
        Other keyword arguments to be passed to the `method` function passed in.

    Returns
    -------
    list
        List of nodes in `G` along a path with an approximation of the minimal
        path through `nodes`.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        If `G` is a directed graph it has to be strongly connected or the
        complete version cannot be generated.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> tsp = nx.approximation.traveling_salesman_problem
    >>> G = nx.cycle_graph(9)
    >>> G[4][5]["weight"] = 5  # all other weights are 1
    >>> tsp(G, nodes=[3, 6])
    [3, 2, 1, 0, 8, 7, 6, 7, 8, 0, 1, 2, 3]
    >>> path = tsp(G, cycle=False)
    >>> path in ([4, 3, 2, 1, 0, 8, 7, 6, 5], [5, 6, 7, 8, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4])
    True

    While no longer required, you can still build (curry) your own function
    to provide parameter values to the methods.

    >>> SA_tsp = nx.approximation.simulated_annealing_tsp
    >>> method = lambda G, weight: SA_tsp(G, "greedy", weight=weight, temp=500)
    >>> path = tsp(G, cycle=False, method=method)
    >>> path in ([4, 3, 2, 1, 0, 8, 7, 6, 5], [5, 6, 7, 8, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4])
    True

    Otherwise, pass other keyword arguments directly into the tsp function.

    >>> path = tsp(
    ...     G,
    ...     cycle=False,
    ...     method=nx.approximation.simulated_annealing_tsp,
    ...     init_cycle="greedy",
    ...     temp=500,
    ... )
    >>> path in ([4, 3, 2, 1, 0, 8, 7, 6, 5], [5, 6, 7, 8, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4])
