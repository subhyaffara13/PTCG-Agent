    """
    Unshard the tensors (e.g., output) that are sharded due to context parallelism.

    Args:
        mesh (:class:`DeviceMesh`): the device mesh for the context parallelism.
        buffers (List[torch.Tensor]): the buffers to be unsharded.
        seq_dims (List[int]): the sequence dimensions of ``buffers``. This list
            must have the same length as ``buffers``.
        load_balancer (Optional[:class:`_Loadbalancer`]): an optional `_LoadBalancer`
            object. If this argument is `None`, it means the `buffers` were not
            rearranged when being sharded and there's no need to put it back to order
            after unsharding. If this argument is a `_LoadBalancer` object, call
            its `_generate_indices(restore=True)` to generate the restore indices such
            that `unsharded[restore_idx]` is the original buffer.

    Returns:
        List[torch.Tensor]: the unsharded buffers.

    Note:
        For `context_parallel_unshard` we require not-None `load_balancer` object be
        explicitly passed if flex_attention() is to be used and load-balancing is needed.
        This is different from the case of SDPA though we strongly suggest users follow
        the same convention.
