def asadpour_atsp(G, weight="weight", seed=None, source=None):
    """
    Returns an approximate solution to the traveling salesman problem.

    This approximate solution is one of the best known approximations for the
    asymmetric traveling salesman problem developed by Asadpour et al,
    [1]_. The algorithm first solves the Held-Karp relaxation to find a lower
    bound for the weight of the cycle. Next, it constructs an exponential
    distribution of undirected spanning trees where the probability of an
    edge being in the tree corresponds to the weight of that edge using a
    maximum entropy rounding scheme. Next we sample that distribution
    $2 \\lceil \\ln n \\rceil$ times and save the minimum sampled tree once the
    direction of the arcs is added back to the edges. Finally, we augment
    then short circuit that graph to find the approximate tour for the
    salesman.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : nx.DiGraph
        The graph should be a complete weighted directed graph. The
        distance between all paris of nodes should be included and the triangle
        inequality should hold. That is, the direct edge between any two nodes
        should be the path of least cost.

    weight : string, optional (default="weight")
        Edge data key corresponding to the edge weight.
        If any edge does not have this attribute the weight is set to 1.

    seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
        Indicator of random number generation state.
        See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.

    source : node label (default=`None`)
        If given, return the cycle starting and ending at the given node.

    Returns
    -------
    cycle : list of nodes
        Returns the cycle (list of nodes) that a salesman can follow to minimize
        the total weight of the trip.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        If `G` is not complete or has less than two nodes, the algorithm raises
        an exception.

    NetworkXError
        If `source` is not `None` and is not a node in `G`, the algorithm raises
        an exception.

    NetworkXNotImplemented
        If `G` is an undirected graph.
