def _iterate_exprs(val: IterateExprs) -> Iterator[sympy.Basic]:
    """
    Recursively iterate through a value and yield all sympy expressions contained within it.

    This function traverses various data structures (tensors, lists, tuples, etc.) and extracts
    any symbolic expressions they contain. It's used for operations like finding free symbols
    in complex nested structures.

    Args:
        val: The value to extract sympy expressions from. Can be a symbolic type (SymInt, SymFloat, SymBool),
             a sympy expression, a primitive type (int, float, bool), a container (tuple, list),
             a sparse tensor, a regular tensor, None, or a torch.Generator.

    Yields:
        sympy.Basic: Each sympy expression found in the value.

    Raises:
        AssertionError: If the value is of an unsupported type.
