def mobius(n):
    """
    Mobius function maps natural number to {-1, 0, 1}

    .. deprecated:: 1.13

        The ``mobius`` function is deprecated. Use :class:`sympy.functions.combinatorial.numbers.mobius`
        instead. See its documentation for more information. See
        :ref:`deprecated-ntheory-symbolic-functions` for details.

    It is defined as follows:
        1) `1` if `n = 1`.
        2) `0` if `n` has a squared prime factor.
        3) `(-1)^k` if `n` is a square-free positive integer with `k`
           number of prime factors.

    It is an important multiplicative function in number theory
    and combinatorics.  It has applications in mathematical series,
    algebraic number theory and also physics (Fermion operator has very
    concrete realization with Mobius Function model).

    Parameters
    ==========

    n : positive integer

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.functions.combinatorial.numbers import mobius
    >>> mobius(13*7)
    1
    >>> mobius(1)
    1
    >>> mobius(13*7*5)
    -1
    >>> mobius(13**2)
    0
