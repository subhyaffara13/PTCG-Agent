def operators_to_state(operators, **options):
    """ Returns the eigenstate of the given operator or set of operators

    A global function for mapping operator classes to their associated
    states. It takes either an Operator or a set of operators and
    returns the state associated with these.

    This function can handle both instances of a given operator or
    just the class itself (i.e. both XOp() and XOp)

    There are multiple use cases to consider:

    1) A class or set of classes is passed: First, we try to
    instantiate default instances for these operators. If this fails,
    then the class is simply returned. If we succeed in instantiating
    default instances, then we try to call state._operators_to_state
    on the operator instances. If this fails, the class is returned.
    Otherwise, the instance returned by _operators_to_state is returned.

    2) An instance or set of instances is passed: In this case,
    state._operators_to_state is called on the instances passed. If
    this fails, a state class is returned. If the method returns an
    instance, that instance is returned.

    In both cases, if the operator class or set does not exist in the
    state_mapping dictionary, None is returned.

    Parameters
    ==========

    arg: Operator or set
         The class or instance of the operator or set of operators
         to be mapped to a state
