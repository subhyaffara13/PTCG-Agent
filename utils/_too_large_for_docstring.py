def _too_large_for_docstring(expr, limit):
    """Decide whether an ``Expr`` is too large to be fully rendered in a
    ``lambdify`` docstring.

    This is a fast alternative to ``count_ops``, which can become prohibitively
    slow for large expressions, because in this instance we only care whether
    ``limit`` is exceeded rather than counting the exact number of nodes in the
    expression.

    Parameters
    ==========
    expr : ``Expr``, (nested) ``list`` of ``Expr``, or ``Matrix``
        The same objects that can be passed to the ``expr`` argument of
        ``lambdify``.
    limit : ``int`` or ``None``
        The threshold above which an expression contains too many nodes to be
        usefully rendered in the docstring. If ``None`` then there is no limit.

    Returns
    =======
    bool
        ``True`` if the number of nodes in the expression exceeds the limit,
        ``False`` otherwise.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y, z
    >>> from sympy.utilities.lambdify import _too_large_for_docstring
    >>> expr = x
    >>> _too_large_for_docstring(expr, None)
    False
    >>> _too_large_for_docstring(expr, 100)
    False
    >>> _too_large_for_docstring(expr, 1)
    False
    >>> _too_large_for_docstring(expr, 0)
    True
    >>> _too_large_for_docstring(expr, -1)
    True

    Does this split it?
