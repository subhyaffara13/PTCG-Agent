def anf_coeffs(truthvalues):
    """
    Convert a list of truth values of some boolean expression
    to the list of coefficients of the polynomial mod 2 (exclusive
    disjunction) representing the boolean expression in ANF
    (i.e., the "Zhegalkin polynomial").

    There are `2^n` possible Zhegalkin monomials in `n` variables, since
    each monomial is fully specified by the presence or absence of
    each variable.

    We can enumerate all the monomials. For example, boolean
    function with four variables ``(a, b, c, d)`` can contain
    up to `2^4 = 16` monomials. The 13-th monomial is the
    product ``a & b & d``, because 13 in binary is 1, 1, 0, 1.

    A given monomial's presence or absence in a polynomial corresponds
    to that monomial's coefficient being 1 or 0 respectively.

    >>> coeffs = anf_coeffs(truthvalues)
    >>> coeffs
    [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]
    >>> polynomial = Xor(*[
    ...     bool_monomial(k, [a, b, c])
    ...     for k, coeff in enumerate(coeffs) if coeff == 1
    ... ])
    >>> polynomial
    b ^ c ^ (a & b)
