    """
    This routine transforms a real symmetric matrix A to a real symmetric
    tridiagonal matrix T using an orthogonal similarity transformation:
          Q' * A * Q = T     (here ' denotes the matrix transpose).
    The orthogonal matrix Q is build up from Householder reflectors.

    parameters:
      A         (input/output) On input, A contains the real symmetric matrix of
                dimension (n,n). On output, if calc_ev is true, A contains the
                orthogonal matrix Q, otherwise A is destroyed.

      D         (output) real array of length n, contains the diagonal elements
                of the tridiagonal matrix

      E         (output) real array of length n, contains the offdiagonal elements
                of the tridiagonal matrix in E[0:(n-1)] where is the dimension of
                the matrix A. E[n-1] is undefined.

      calc_ev   (input) If calc_ev is true, this routine explicitly calculates the
                orthogonal matrix Q which is then returned in A. If calc_ev is
                false, Q is not explicitly calculated resulting in a shorter run time.

    This routine is a python translation of the fortran routine tred2.f in the
    software library EISPACK (see netlib.org) which itself is based on the algol
    procedure tred2 described in:
      - Num. Math. 11, p.181-195 (1968) by Martin, Reinsch and Wilkonson
      - Handbook for auto. comp., Vol II, Linear Algebra, p.212-226 (1971)
