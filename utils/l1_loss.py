    r"""Compute the L1 loss, with optional weighting.

    Function that takes the mean element-wise absolute value difference.

    See :class:`~torch.nn.L1Loss` for details.

    Args:
        input (Tensor): Predicted values.
        target (Tensor): Ground truth values.
        size_average (bool, optional): Deprecated (see :attr:`reduction`).
        reduce (bool, optional): Deprecated (see :attr:`reduction`).
        reduction (str, optional): Specifies the reduction to apply to the output:
                                   'none' | 'mean' | 'sum'. 'mean': the mean of the output is taken.
                                   'sum': the output will be summed. 'none': no reduction will be applied.
                                   Default: 'mean'.
        weight (Tensor, optional): Weights for each sample. Default: None.

    Returns:
        Tensor: L1 loss (optionally weighted).
