    """Returns an extended Barabási–Albert model graph.

    An extended Barabási–Albert model graph is a random graph constructed
    using preferential attachment. The extended model allows new edges,
    rewired edges or new nodes. Based on the probabilities $p$ and $q$
    with $p + q < 1$, the growing behavior of the graph is determined as:

    1) With $p$ probability, $m$ new edges are added to the graph,
    starting from randomly chosen existing nodes and attached preferentially at the
    other end.

    2) With $q$ probability, $m$ existing edges are rewired
    by randomly choosing an edge and rewiring one end to a preferentially chosen node.

    3) With $(1 - p - q)$ probability, $m$ new nodes are added to the graph
    with edges attached preferentially.

    When $p = q = 0$, the model behaves just like the Barabási–Alber model.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : int
        Number of nodes
    m : int
        Number of edges with which a new node attaches to existing nodes
    p : float
        Probability value for adding an edge between existing nodes. p + q < 1
    q : float
        Probability value of rewiring of existing edges. p + q < 1
    seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
        Indicator of random number generation state.
        See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.
    create_using : Graph constructor, optional (default=nx.Graph)
        Graph type to create. If graph instance, then cleared before populated.
        Multigraph and directed types are not supported and raise a ``NetworkXError``.

    Returns
    -------
    G : Graph

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        If `m` does not satisfy ``1 <= m < n`` or ``1 >= p + q``
