def disambiguate(*iter):
    """
    Return a Tuple containing the passed expressions with symbols
    that appear the same when printed replaced with numerically
    subscripted symbols, and all Dummy symbols replaced with Symbols.

    Parameters
    ==========

    iter: list of symbols or expressions.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.core.symbol import disambiguate
    >>> from sympy import Dummy, Symbol, Tuple
    >>> from sympy.abc import y

    >>> tup = Symbol('_x'), Dummy('x'), Dummy('x')
    >>> disambiguate(*tup)
    (x_2, x, x_1)

    >>> eqs = Tuple(Symbol('x')/y, Dummy('x')/y)
    >>> disambiguate(*eqs)
    (x_1/y, x/y)

    >>> ix = Symbol('x', integer=True)
    >>> vx = Symbol('x')
    >>> disambiguate(vx + ix)
    (x + x_1,)

    To make your own mapping of symbols to use, pass only the free symbols
    of the expressions and create a dictionary:

    >>> free = eqs.free_symbols
    >>> mapping = dict(zip(free, disambiguate(*free)))
    >>> eqs.xreplace(mapping)
    (x_1/y, x/y)
