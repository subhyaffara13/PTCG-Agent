    r'''
    Load a PyTorch C++ extension just-in-time (JIT) from string sources.

    This function behaves exactly like :func:`load`, but takes its sources as
    strings rather than filenames. These strings are stored to files in the
    build directory, after which the behavior of :func:`load_inline` is
    identical to :func:`load`.

    See `the
    tests <https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/master/test/test_cpp_extensions_jit.py>`_
    for good examples of using this function.

    Sources may omit two required parts of a typical non-inline C++ extension:
    the necessary header includes, as well as the (pybind11) binding code. More
    precisely, strings passed to ``cpp_sources`` are first concatenated into a
    single ``.cpp`` file. This file is then prepended with ``#include
    <torch/extension.h>``

    Furthermore, if the ``functions`` argument is supplied, bindings will be
    automatically generated for each function specified. ``functions`` can
    either be a list of function names, or a dictionary mapping from function
    names to docstrings. If a list is given, the name of each function is used
    as its docstring.

    The sources in ``cuda_sources`` are concatenated into a separate ``.cu``
    file and  prepended with ``torch/types.h``, ``cuda.h`` and
    ``cuda_runtime.h`` includes. The ``.cpp`` and ``.cu`` files are compiled
    separately, but ultimately linked into a single library. Note that no
    bindings are generated for functions in ``cuda_sources`` per se. To bind
    to a CUDA kernel, you must create a C++ function that calls it, and either
    declare or define this C++ function in one of the ``cpp_sources`` (and
    include its name in ``functions``).

    The sources in ``sycl_sources`` are concatenated into a separate ``.sycl``
    file and  prepended with ``torch/types.h``, ``sycl/sycl.hpp`` includes.
    The ``.cpp`` and ``.sycl`` files are compiled separately, but ultimately
    linked into a single library. Note that no bindings are generated for
    functions in ``sycl_sources`` per se. To bind to a SYCL kernel, you must
    create a C++ function that calls it, and either declare or define this
    C++ function in one of the ``cpp_sources`` (and include its name
    in ``functions``).



    See :func:`load` for a description of arguments omitted below.

    Args:
        cpp_sources: A string, or list of strings, containing C++ source code.
        cuda_sources: A string, or list of strings, containing CUDA source code.
        sycl_sources: A string, or list of strings, containing SYCL source code.
        functions: A list of function names for which to generate function
            bindings. If a dictionary is given, it should map function names to
            docstrings (which are otherwise just the function names).
        with_cuda: Determines whether CUDA headers and libraries are added to
            the build. If set to ``None`` (default), this value is
            automatically determined based on whether ``cuda_sources`` is
            provided. Set it to ``True`` to force CUDA headers
            and libraries to be included.
        with_sycl: Determines whether SYCL headers and libraries are added to
            the build. If set to ``None`` (default), this value is
            automatically determined based on whether ``sycl_sources`` is
            provided. Set it to ``True`` to force SYCL headers
            and libraries to be included.
        with_pytorch_error_handling: Determines whether pytorch error and
            warning macros are handled by pytorch instead of pybind. To do
            this, each function ``foo`` is called via an intermediary ``_safe_foo``
            function. This redirection might cause issues in obscure cases
            of cpp. This flag should be set to ``False`` when this redirect
            causes issues.
        no_implicit_headers: If ``True``, skips automatically adding headers, most notably
            ``#include <torch/extension.h>`` and ``#include <torch/types.h>`` lines.
            Use this option to improve cold start times when you
            already include the necessary headers in your source code. Default: ``False``.

    Example:
        >>> # xdoctest: +REQUIRES(env:TORCH_DOCTEST_CPP_EXT)
        >>> from torch.utils.cpp_extension import load_inline
        >>> source = """
        at::Tensor sin_add(at::Tensor x, at::Tensor y) {
          return x.sin() + y.sin();
        }
        """
        >>> module = load_inline(name='inline_extension',
        ...                      cpp_sources=[source],
        ...                      functions=['sin_add'])

    .. note::
        Since load_inline will just-in-time compile the source code, please ensure
        that you have the right toolchains installed in the runtime. For example,
        when loading C++, make sure a C++ compiler is available. If you're loading
        a CUDA extension, you will need to additionally install the corresponding CUDA
        toolkit (nvcc and any other dependencies your code has). Compiling toolchains
        are not included when you install torch and must be additionally installed.

        During compiling, by default, the Ninja backend uses #CPUS + 2 workers to build
        the extension. This may use up too many resources on some systems. One
        can control the number of workers by setting the `MAX_JOBS` environment
        variable to a non-negative number.
