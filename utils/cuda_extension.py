    Create a :class:`setuptools.Extension` for CUDA/C++.

    Convenience method that creates a :class:`setuptools.Extension` with the
    bare minimum (but often sufficient) arguments to build a CUDA/C++
    extension. This includes the CUDA include path, library path and runtime
    library.

    All arguments are forwarded to the :class:`setuptools.Extension`
    constructor. Full list arguments can be found at
    https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/ext_modules.html#extension-api-reference

    .. warning::
        The PyTorch python API (as provided in libtorch_python) cannot be built
        with the flag ``py_limited_api=True``.  When this flag is passed, it is
        the user's responsibility in their library to not use APIs from
        libtorch_python (in particular pytorch/python bindings) and to only use
        APIs from libtorch (aten objects, operators and the dispatcher). For
        example, to give access to custom ops from python, the library should
        register the ops through the dispatcher.

        Contrary to CPython setuptools, who does not define -DPy_LIMITED_API
        as a compile flag when py_limited_api is specified as an option for
        the "bdist_wheel" command in ``setup``, PyTorch does! We will specify
        -DPy_LIMITED_API=min_supported_cpython to best enforce consistency,
        safety, and sanity in order to encourage best practices. To target a
        different version, set min_supported_cpython to the hexcode of the
        CPython version of choice.

    Example:
        >>> # xdoctest: +SKIP
        >>> # xdoctest: +REQUIRES(env:TORCH_DOCTEST_CPP_EXT)
        >>> from setuptools import setup
        >>> from torch.utils.cpp_extension import BuildExtension, CUDAExtension
        >>> setup(
        ...     name='cuda_extension',
        ...     ext_modules=[
        ...         CUDAExtension(
        ...                 name='cuda_extension',
        ...                 sources=['extension.cpp', 'extension_kernel.cu'],
        ...                 extra_compile_args={'cxx': ['-g'],
        ...                                     'nvcc': ['-O2']},
        ...                 extra_link_args=['-Wl,--no-as-needed', '-lcuda'])
        ...     ],
        ...     cmdclass={
        ...         'build_ext': BuildExtension
        ...     })

    Compute capabilities:

    By default the extension will be compiled to run on all archs of the cards visible during the
    building process of the extension, plus PTX. If down the road a new card is installed the
    extension may need to be recompiled. If a visible card has a compute capability (CC) that's
    newer than the newest version for which your nvcc can build fully-compiled binaries, PyTorch
    will make nvcc fall back to building kernels with the newest version of PTX your nvcc does
    support (see below for details on PTX).

    You can override the default behavior using `TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST` to explicitly specify which
    CCs you want the extension to support:

    ``TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST="6.1 8.6" python build_my_extension.py``
    ``TORCH_CUDA_ARCH_LIST="5.2 6.0 6.1 7.0 7.5 8.0 8.6+PTX" python build_my_extension.py``

    The +PTX option causes extension kernel binaries to include PTX instructions for the specified
    CC. PTX is an intermediate representation that allows kernels to runtime-compile for any CC >=
    the specified CC (for example, 8.6+PTX generates PTX that can runtime-compile for any GPU with
    CC >= 8.6). This improves your binary's forward compatibility. However, relying on older PTX to
    provide forward compat by runtime-compiling for newer CCs can modestly reduce performance on
    those newer CCs. If you know exact CC(s) of the GPUs you want to target, you're always better
    off specifying them individually. For example, if you want your extension to run on 8.0 and 8.6,
    "8.0+PTX" would work functionally because it includes PTX that can runtime-compile for 8.6, but
    "8.0 8.6" would be better.

    Note that while it's possible to include all supported archs, the more archs get included the
    slower the building process will be, as it will build a separate kernel image for each arch.

    Note that CUDA-11.5 nvcc will hit internal compiler error while parsing torch/extension.h on Windows.
    To workaround the issue, move python binding logic to pure C++ file.

    Example use:
        #include <ATen/ATen.h>
        at::Tensor SigmoidAlphaBlendForwardCuda(....)

    Instead of:
        #include <torch/extension.h>
        torch::Tensor SigmoidAlphaBlendForwardCuda(...)

    Currently open issue for nvcc bug: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/69460

    Relocatable device code linking:

    If you want to reference device symbols across compilation units (across object files),
    the object files need to be built with `relocatable device code` (-rdc=true or -dc).
    An exception to this rule is "dynamic parallelism" (nested kernel launches)  which is not used a lot anymore.
    `Relocatable device code` is less optimized so it needs to be used only on object files that need it.
    Using `-dlto` (Device Link Time Optimization) at the device code compilation step and `dlink` step
    helps reduce the protentional perf degradation of `-rdc`.
    Note that it needs to be used at both steps to be useful.

    If you have `rdc` objects you need to have an extra `-dlink` (device linking) step before the CPU symbol linking step.
    There is also a case where `-dlink` is used without `-rdc`:
    when an extension is linked against a static lib containing rdc-compiled objects
    like the [NVSHMEM library](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvshmem).

    Note: Ninja is required to build a CUDA Extension with RDC linking.

    Example:
        >>> # xdoctest: +SKIP
        >>> # xdoctest: +REQUIRES(env:TORCH_DOCTEST_CPP_EXT)
        >>> CUDAExtension(
        ...        name='cuda_extension',

        ...                            'nvcc': ['-O2', '-rdc=true']})
