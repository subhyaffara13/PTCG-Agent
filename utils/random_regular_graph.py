def random_regular_graph(d, n, seed=None, *, create_using=None):
    r"""Returns a random $d$-regular graph on $n$ nodes.

    A regular graph is a graph where each node has the same number of neighbors.

    The resulting graph has no self-loops or parallel edges.

    Parameters
    ----------
    d : int
      The degree of each node.
    n : integer
      The number of nodes. The value of $n \times d$ must be even.
    seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
        Indicator of random number generation state.
        See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.
    create_using : Graph constructor, optional (default=nx.Graph)
        Graph type to create. If graph instance, then cleared before populated.
        Multigraph and directed types are not supported and raise a ``NetworkXError``.

    Notes
    -----
    The nodes are numbered from $0$ to $n - 1$.

    Kim and Vu's paper [2]_ shows that this algorithm samples in an
    asymptotically uniform way from the space of random graphs when
    $d = O(n^{1 / 3 - \epsilon})$.

    Raises
    ------

    NetworkXError
        If $n \times d$ is odd or $d$ is greater than or equal to $n$.
