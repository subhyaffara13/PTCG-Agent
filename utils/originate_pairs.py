    """Originates pairs from the individual inputs.

    ``actual`` and ``expected`` can be possibly nested :class:`~collections.abc.Sequence`'s or
    :class:`~collections.abc.Mapping`'s. In this case the pairs are originated by recursing through them.

    Args:
        actual (Any): Actual input.
        expected (Any): Expected input.
        pair_types (Sequence[Type[Pair]]): Sequence of pair types that will be tried to construct with the inputs.
            First successful pair will be used.
        sequence_types (Tuple[Type, ...]): Optional types treated as sequences that will be checked elementwise.
        mapping_types (Tuple[Type, ...]): Optional types treated as mappings that will be checked elementwise.
        id (Tuple[Any, ...]): Optional id of a pair that will be included in an error message.
        **options (Any): Options passed to each pair during construction.

    Raises:
        ErrorMeta: With :class`AssertionError`, if the inputs are :class:`~collections.abc.Sequence`'s, but their
            length does not match.
        ErrorMeta: With :class`AssertionError`, if the inputs are :class:`~collections.abc.Mapping`'s, but their set of
            keys do not match.
        ErrorMeta: With :class`TypeError`, if no pair is able to handle the inputs.
        ErrorMeta: With any expected exception that happens during the construction of a pair.

    Returns:
        (List[Pair]): Originated pairs.
