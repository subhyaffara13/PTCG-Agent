def guess(l, all=False, evaluate=True, niter=2, variables=None):
    """
    This function is adapted from the Rate.m package for Mathematica
    written by Christian Krattenthaler.
    It tries to guess a formula from a given sequence of rational numbers.

    Explanation
    ===========

    In order to speed up the process, the 'all' variable is set to False by
    default, stopping the computation as some results are returned during an
    iteration; the variable can be set to True if more iterations are needed
    (other formulas may be found; however they may be equivalent to the first
    ones).

    Another option is the 'evaluate' variable (default is True); setting it
    to False will leave the involved products unevaluated.

    By default, the number of iterations is set to 2 but a greater value (up
    to len(l)-1) can be specified with the optional 'niter' variable.
    More and more convoluted results are found when the order of the
    iteration gets higher:

      * first iteration returns polynomial or rational functions;
      * second iteration returns products of rising factorials and their
        inverses;
      * third iteration returns products of products of rising factorials
        and their inverses;
      * etc.

    The returned formulas contain symbols i0, i1, i2, ... where the main
    variables is i0 (and auxiliary variables are i1, i2, ...). A list of
    other symbols can be provided in the 'variables' option; the length of
    the least should be the value of 'niter' (more is acceptable but only
    the first symbols will be used); in this case, the main variable will be
    the first symbol in the list.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.concrete.guess import guess
    >>> guess([1,2,6,24,120], evaluate=False)
    [Product(i1 + 1, (i1, 1, i0 - 1))]

    >>> from sympy import symbols
    >>> r = guess([1,2,7,42,429,7436,218348,10850216], niter=4)
    >>> i0 = symbols("i0")
    >>> [r[0].subs(i0,n).doit() for n in range(1,10)]
    [1, 2, 7, 42, 429, 7436, 218348, 10850216, 911835460]
