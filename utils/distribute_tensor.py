    """
    Distribute a leaf ``torch.Tensor`` (i.e. nn.Parameter/buffers) to the ``device_mesh`` according
    to the ``placements`` specified. The rank of ``device_mesh`` and ``placements`` must be the
    same. The ``tensor`` to distribute is the logical or "global" tensor, and the API would use
    the ``tensor`` from first rank of the DeviceMesh dimension as the source of truth to preserve
    the single-device semantic. If you want to construct a DTensor in the middle of the Autograd
    computation, please use :meth:`DTensor.from_local` instead.

    Args:
        tensor (torch.Tensor): torch.Tensor to be distributed. Note that if you
            want to shard a tensor on a dimension that is not evenly divisible by
            the number of devices in that mesh dimension, we use ``torch.chunk``
            semantic to shard the tensor and scatter the shards. The uneven sharding
            behavior is experimental and subject to change.
        device_mesh (:class:`DeviceMesh`, optional): DeviceMesh to distribute the
            tensor, if not specified, must be called under a DeviceMesh context
            manager, default: None
        placements (List[:class:`Placement`], optional): the placements that
            describes how to place the tensor on DeviceMesh, must have the same
            number of elements as ``device_mesh.ndim``. If not specified, we will
            by default replicate the tensor across the ``device_mesh`` from the
            first rank of each dimension of the `device_mesh`.

    Keyword args:
        src_data_rank (int, optional): the rank of the source data for the logical/global tensor, it is
            used by :meth:`distribute_tensor` to scatter/broadcast the shards/replicas to other ranks.
            By default, we use ``group_rank=0`` on each DeviceMesh dimension as the source data to preserve
            the single-device semantic. If passing ``None`` explicitly, :meth:`distribute_tensor` simply uses
            its local data instead of trying to preserve the single-device semantic via scatter/broadcast.
            Default: 0

    Returns:
        A :class:`DTensor` or ``XLAShardedTensor`` object.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If ``placements`` contains mixed :class:`Partial` reduce types
            (e.g., both ``Partial("sum")`` and ``Partial("max")``). All Partial
            placements must use the same reduce operation.

    .. note::
        When initialize the DeviceMesh with the ``xla`` device_type, ``distribute_tensor``
        return `XLAShardedTensor` instead. see `this issue <https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/92909>`__
        for more details. The XLA integration is experimental and subject to change.
