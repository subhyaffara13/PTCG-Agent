def encipher_substitution(msg, old, new=None):
    r"""
    Returns the ciphertext obtained by replacing each character that
    appears in ``old`` with the corresponding character in ``new``.
    If ``old`` is a mapping, then new is ignored and the replacements
    defined by ``old`` are used.

    Explanation
    ===========

    This is a more general than the affine cipher in that the key can
    only be recovered by determining the mapping for each symbol.
    Though in practice, once a few symbols are recognized the mappings
    for other characters can be quickly guessed.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.crypto.crypto import encipher_substitution, AZ
    >>> old = 'OEYAG'
    >>> new = '034^6'
    >>> msg = AZ("go navy! beat army!")
    >>> ct = encipher_substitution(msg, old, new); ct
    '60N^V4B3^T^RM4'

    To decrypt a substitution, reverse the last two arguments:

    >>> encipher_substitution(ct, new, old)
    'GONAVYBEATARMY'

    In the special case where ``old`` and ``new`` are a permutation of
    order 2 (representing a transposition of characters) their order
    is immaterial:

    >>> old = 'NAVY'
    >>> new = 'ANYV'
    >>> encipher = lambda x: encipher_substitution(x, old, new)
    >>> encipher('NAVY')
    'ANYV'
    >>> encipher(_)
    'NAVY'

    The substitution cipher, in general, is a method
    whereby "units" (not necessarily single characters) of plaintext
    are replaced with ciphertext according to a regular system.

    >>> ords = dict(zip('abc', ['\\%i' % ord(i) for i in 'abc']))
    >>> print(encipher_substitution('abc', ords))
    \97\98\99
