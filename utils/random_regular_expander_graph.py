def random_regular_expander_graph(
    n, d, *, epsilon=0, create_using=None, max_tries=100, seed=None
):
    r"""Returns a random regular expander graph on $n$ nodes with degree $d$.

    An expander graph is a sparse graph with strong connectivity properties. [1]_

    More precisely the returned graph is a $(n, d, \lambda)$-expander with
    $\lambda = 2 \sqrt{d - 1} + \epsilon$, close to the Alon-Boppana bound. [2]_

    In the case where $\epsilon = 0$ it returns a Ramanujan graph.
    A Ramanujan graph has spectral gap almost as large as possible,
    which makes them excellent expanders. [3]_

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : int
      The number of nodes.
    d : int
      The degree of each node.
    epsilon : int, float, default=0
    max_tries : int, (default: 100)
      The number of allowed loops,
      also used in the `maybe_regular_expander_graph` utility
    seed : (default: None)
      Seed used to set random number generation state. See :ref`Randomness<randomness>`.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        If max_tries is reached

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.random_regular_expander_graph(20, 4)
    >>> nx.is_regular_expander(G)
    True

    Notes
    -----
    This loops over `maybe_regular_expander_graph` and can be slow when
    $n$ is too big or $\epsilon$ too small.
