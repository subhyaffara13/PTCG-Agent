    """
    Checks if f can be written as the logarithmic derivative of a k(t)-radical.

    Explanation
    ===========

    It differs from is_log_deriv_k_t_radical(fa, fd, DE, Df=False)
    for any given fa, fd, DE in that it finds the solution in the
    given field not in some (possibly unspecified extension) and
    "in_field" with the function name is used to indicate that.

    f in k(t) can be written as the logarithmic derivative of a k(t) radical if
    there exist n in ZZ and u in k(t) with n, u != 0 such that n*f == Du/u.
    Either returns (n, u) or None, which means that f cannot be written as the
    logarithmic derivative of a k(t)-radical.

    case is one of {'primitive', 'exp', 'tan', 'auto'} for the primitive,
    hyperexponential, and hypertangent cases, respectively.  If case is 'auto',
    it will attempt to determine the type of the derivation automatically.
