def refraction_angle(incident, medium1, medium2, normal=None, plane=None):
    """
    This function calculates transmitted vector after refraction at planar
    surface. ``medium1`` and ``medium2`` can be ``Medium`` or any sympifiable object.
    If ``incident`` is a number then treated as angle of incidence (in radians)
    in which case refraction angle is returned.

    If ``incident`` is an object of `Ray3D`, `normal` also has to be an instance
    of `Ray3D` in order to get the output as a `Ray3D`. Please note that if
    plane of separation is not provided and normal is an instance of `Ray3D`,
    ``normal`` will be assumed to be intersecting incident ray at the plane of
    separation. This will not be the case when `normal` is a `Matrix` or
    any other sequence.
    If ``incident`` is an instance of `Ray3D` and `plane` has not been provided
    and ``normal`` is not `Ray3D`, output will be a `Matrix`.

    Parameters
    ==========

    incident : Matrix, Ray3D, sequence or a number
        Incident vector or angle of incidence
    medium1 : sympy.physics.optics.medium.Medium or sympifiable
        Medium 1 or its refractive index
    medium2 : sympy.physics.optics.medium.Medium or sympifiable
        Medium 2 or its refractive index
    normal : Matrix, Ray3D, or sequence
        Normal vector
    plane : Plane
        Plane of separation of the two media.

    Returns
    =======

    Returns an angle of refraction or a refracted ray depending on inputs.
