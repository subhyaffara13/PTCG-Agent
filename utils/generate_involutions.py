    Generates involutions.

    An involution is a permutation that when multiplied
    by itself equals the identity permutation. In this
    implementation the involutions are generated using
    Fixed Points.

    Alternatively, an involution can be considered as
    a permutation that does not contain any cycles with
    a length that is greater than two.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.utilities.iterables import generate_involutions
    >>> list(generate_involutions(3))
    [(0, 1, 2), (0, 2, 1), (1, 0, 2), (2, 1, 0)]
    >>> len(list(generate_involutions(4)))
    10
