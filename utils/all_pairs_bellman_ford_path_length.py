def all_pairs_bellman_ford_path_length(G, weight="weight"):
    """Compute shortest path lengths between all nodes in a weighted graph.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    weight : string or function (default="weight")
        If this is a string, then edge weights will be accessed via the
        edge attribute with this key (that is, the weight of the edge
        joining `u` to `v` will be ``G.edges[u, v][weight]``). If no
        such edge attribute exists, the weight of the edge is assumed to
        be one.

        If this is a function, the weight of an edge is the value
        returned by the function. The function must accept exactly three
        positional arguments: the two endpoints of an edge and the
        dictionary of edge attributes for that edge. The function must
        return a number.

    Returns
    -------
    distance : iterator
        (source, dictionary) iterator with dictionary keyed by target and
        shortest path length as the key value.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.path_graph(5)
    >>> length = dict(nx.all_pairs_bellman_ford_path_length(G))
    >>> for node in [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]:
    ...     print(f"1 - {node}: {length[1][node]}")
    1 - 0: 1
    1 - 1: 0
    1 - 2: 1
    1 - 3: 2
    1 - 4: 3
    >>> length[3][2]
    1
    >>> length[2][2]
    0

    Notes
    -----
    Edge weight attributes must be numerical.
    Distances are calculated as sums of weighted edges traversed.

    The dictionary returned only has keys for reachable node pairs.
