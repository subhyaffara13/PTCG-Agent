def copy_current_request_context(f: F) -> F:
    """A helper function that decorates a function to retain the current
    request context.  This is useful when working with greenlets.  The moment
    the function is decorated a copy of the request context is created and
    then pushed when the function is called.  The current session is also
    included in the copied request context.

    Example::

        import gevent
        from flask import copy_current_request_context

        @app.route('/')
        def index():
            @copy_current_request_context
            def do_some_work():
                # do some work here, it can access flask.request or
                # flask.session like you would otherwise in the view function.
                ...
            gevent.spawn(do_some_work)
            return 'Regular response'
