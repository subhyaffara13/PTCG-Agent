def edge_expansion(G, S, T=None, weight=None):
    """Returns the edge expansion between two node sets.

    The *edge expansion* is the quotient of the cut size and the smaller
    of the cardinalities of the two sets. [1]

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    S : collection
        A collection of nodes in `G`.

    T : collection
        A collection of nodes in `G`.

    weight : object
        Edge attribute key to use as weight. If not specified, edges
        have weight one.

    Returns
    -------
    number
        The edge expansion between the two sets `S` and `T`.
