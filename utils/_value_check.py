def _value_check(condition, message):
    """
    Raise a ValueError with message if condition is False, else
    return True if all conditions were True, else False.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.stats.rv import _value_check
    >>> from sympy.abc import a, b, c
    >>> from sympy import And, Dummy

    >>> _value_check(2 < 3, '')
    True

    Here, the condition is not False, but it does not evaluate to True
    so False is returned (but no error is raised). So checking if the
    return value is True or False will tell you if all conditions were
    evaluated.

    >>> _value_check(a < b, '')
    False

    In this case the condition is False so an error is raised:

    >>> r = Dummy(real=True)
    >>> _value_check(r < r - 1, 'condition is not true')
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ValueError: condition is not true

    If no condition of many conditions must be False, they can be
    checked by passing them as an iterable:

    >>> _value_check((a < 0, b < 0, c < 0), '')
    False

    The iterable can be a generator, too:

    >>> _value_check((i < 0 for i in (a, b, c)), '')
    False

    The following are equivalent to the above but do not pass
    an iterable:

    >>> all(_value_check(i < 0, '') for i in (a, b, c))
    False
    >>> _value_check(And(a < 0, b < 0, c < 0), '')
    False

    if not iterable(condition):
        condition = [condition]
    truth = fuzzy_and(condition)
    if truth == False:
        raise ValueError(message)
    return truth == True
