def use(backend, *, force=True):
    """
    Select the backend used for rendering and GUI integration.

    If pyplot is already imported, `~matplotlib.pyplot.switch_backend` is used
    to switch the backend.

    Parameters
    ----------
    backend : str
        The backend to switch to.  This can either be one of the standard
        backend names, which are case-insensitive:

        - interactive backends:
          GTK3Agg, GTK3Cairo, GTK4Agg, GTK4Cairo, MacOSX, nbAgg, notebook, QtAgg,
          QtCairo, TkAgg, TkCairo, WebAgg, WX, WXAgg, WXCairo, Qt5Agg, Qt5Cairo

        - non-interactive backends:
          agg, cairo, pdf, pgf, ps, svg, template

        or a string of the form: ``module://my.module.name``.

        notebook is a synonym for nbAgg.

        Switching to an interactive backend is not possible if an unrelated
        event loop has already been started (e.g., switching to GTK3Agg if a
        TkAgg window has already been opened).  Switching to a non-interactive
        backend is always possible.

    force : bool, default: True
        If True (the default), raise an `ImportError` if the backend cannot be
        set up (either because it fails to import, or because an incompatible
        GUI interactive framework is already running); if False, silently
        ignore the failure.

    Use Matplotlib style settings from a style specification.

    .. note::

       This updates the `.rcParams` with the settings from the style.
       `.rcParams` not defined in the style are kept.

    Parameters
    ----------
    style : str, dict, Path or list

        A style specification. Valid options are:

        str
            - One of the style names in `.style.available` (a builtin style or
              a style installed in the user library path).

            - A dotted name of the form "package.style_name"; in that case,
              "package" should be an importable Python package name, e.g. at
              ``/path/to/package/__init__.py``; the loaded style file is
              ``/path/to/package/style_name.mplstyle``.  (Style files in
              subpackages are likewise supported.)

            - The path or URL to a style file, which gets loaded by
              `.rc_params_from_file`.

        dict
            A mapping of key/value pairs for `matplotlib.rcParams`.

        Path
            The path to a style file, which gets loaded by
            `.rc_params_from_file`.

        list
            A list of style specifiers (str, Path or dict), which are applied
            from first to last in the list.

    Notes
    -----
    The following `.rcParams` are not related to style and will be ignored if
    found in a style specification:
