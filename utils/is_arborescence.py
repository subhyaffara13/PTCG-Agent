def is_arborescence(G):
    """
    Returns True if `G` is an arborescence.

    An arborescence is a directed tree with maximum in-degree equal to 1.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
        The graph to test.

    Returns
    -------
    b : bool
        A boolean that is True if `G` is an arborescence.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.DiGraph([(0, 1), (0, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)])
    >>> nx.is_arborescence(G)
    True
    >>> G.remove_edge(0, 1)
    >>> G.add_edge(1, 2)  # maximum in-degree is 2
    >>> nx.is_arborescence(G)
    False

    Notes
    -----
    In another convention, an arborescence is known as a *tree*.
