def state_to_operators(state, **options):
    """ Returns the operator or set of operators corresponding to the
    given eigenstate

    A global function for mapping state classes to their associated
    operators or sets of operators. It takes either a state class
    or instance.

    This function can handle both instances of a given state or just
    the class itself (i.e. both XKet() and XKet)

    There are multiple use cases to consider:

    1) A state class is passed: In this case, we first try
    instantiating a default instance of the class. If this succeeds,
    then we try to call state._state_to_operators on that instance.
    If the creation of the default instance or if the calling of
    _state_to_operators fails, then either an operator class or set of
    operator classes is returned. Otherwise, the appropriate
    operator instances are returned.

    2) A state instance is returned: Here, state._state_to_operators
    is called for the instance. If this fails, then a class or set of
    operator classes is returned. Otherwise, the instances are returned.

    In either case, if the state's class does not exist in
    state_mapping, None is returned.

    Parameters
    ==========

    arg: StateBase class or instance (or subclasses)
         The class or instance of the state to be mapped to an
         operator or set of operators
