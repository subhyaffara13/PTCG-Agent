    Create subgroups by dividing the global world.

    The division is specified by a nested list of ranks. The subgroups cannot have
    overlap, and some ranks may not have to be in any subgroup.

    This is a convenience API that calls ``new_group`` to generate multiple subgroups.
    It requires that all processes in the main group (i.e. all
    processes that are part of the distributed job) enter this function, even
    if they are not going to be members of the group.

    .. warning::
        See warning `Safe concurrent usage` for `new_group` API for important details about
        using multiple process groups concurrently in a safe manner.

    Args:
        ranks_per_subgroup_list (list[list[int]]): A nested list of ranks of
            group members.
        timeout (timedelta, optional): see `init_process_group` for details and default value.
        backend (str or Backend, optional): The backend to use. Depending on
             build-time configurations, valid values are ``gloo`` and ``nccl``.
             By default uses the same backend as the global group. This field
             should be given as a lowercase string (e.g., ``"gloo"``), which can
             also be accessed via :class:`Backend` attributes (e.g.,
             ``Backend.GLOO``). If ``None`` is passed in, the backend
             corresponding to the default process group will be used. Default is
             ``None``.
        pg_options (ProcessGroupOptions, optional): process group options
            specifying what additional options need to be passed in during
            the construction of specific process groups. i.e. for the ``nccl``
            backend, ``is_high_priority_stream`` can be specified so that
            process group can pick up high priority cuda streams.
        group_desc (str, optional): A string describing the group. Each subgroup will
            inherit its group_desc.

    Returns:
        The subgroup containing the current rank, and all the subgroups used for cleanup.

    Examples:
        >>> # Create two subgroups, where each has 2 processes.
        >>> # xdoctest: +SKIP("need process group init")
        >>> cur_subgroup, subgroups = dist.new_subgroups(ranks=[[0, 2], [1, 3]])
        >>> rank = dist.get_rank()
        >>> tensor = torch.ones(1, device=rank) * rank
        >>> dist.all_reduce(tensor, group=cur_subgroup)
        >>> tensor
        tensor([2])     # Subgroup 0: ranks 0 and 2
        tensor([4])     # Subgroup 1: ranks 1 and 3
