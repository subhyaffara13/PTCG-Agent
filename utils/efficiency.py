def efficiency(G, u, v):
    """Returns the efficiency of a pair of nodes in a graph.

    The *efficiency* of a pair of nodes is the multiplicative inverse of the
    shortest path distance between the nodes [1]_. Returns 0 if no path
    between nodes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : :class:`networkx.Graph`
        An undirected graph for which to compute the average local efficiency.
    u, v : node
        Nodes in the graph ``G``.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        Multiplicative inverse of the shortest path distance between the nodes.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.Graph([(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3)])
    >>> nx.efficiency(G, 2, 3)  # this gives efficiency for node 2 and 3
    0.5

    Notes
    -----
    Edge weights are ignored when computing the shortest path distances.
