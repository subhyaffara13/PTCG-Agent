    Returns ``(epoch, release, suffix)`` or

    comparison gives the correct order.

    Trailing zeros are stripped from the release so that ``1.0.0 == 1``.

    The suffix is a flat 6-int tuple that encodes pre/post/dev:
    ``(pre_rank, pre_n, post_rank, post_n, dev_rank, dev_n)``

    pre_rank: dev-only=-1, a=0, b=1, rc=2, no-pre=3
        Dev-only releases (no pre or post) get -1 so they sort before
        any alpha/beta/rc.  Releases without a pre-release tag get 3
        so they sort after rc.
    post_rank: no-post=0, post=1
        Releases without a post segment sort before those with one.
    dev_rank: dev=0, no-dev=1
        Releases without a dev segment sort after those with one.

    Local segments use ``(n, "")`` for ints and ``(-1, s)`` for strings,
    following PEP 440: strings sort before ints, strings compare
    lexicographically, ints compare numerically, and shorter segments
    sort before longer when prefixes match.  Versions without a local
    segment sort before those with one (3-tuple < 4-tuple).
