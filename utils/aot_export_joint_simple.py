    A simplified version of export. Used by higher order operators.

    This function makes a high-level "no calling convention changes" guarantee:
    - If no inputs require grad (so we export an inference graph),
      there are *no* calling convention change between the exported graph, and "func".
    - If at least one input requires grad (so we trace out and export a joint fw-bw graph),
      Then if you were partition the graph into a separate forward and backward graph,
      The forward graph will have no calling convention changes compared to "func".

    The above also relies on some strong restrictions around which functions this API accepts:
    (1) `args` cannot contain any pytrees (they must have been pytree_flattened already)
    (2) `func` cannot mutate any inputs
    (3) The outputs of `func` cannot alias any inputs.

    Note: this function is only lightly tested today. It will probably be tested more heavily by higher order ops.
