    """Extract closure contents as a flattened sub-pytree.

    Returns (extracted_leaves, closure_spec, fn_or_stripped) where:
    - extracted_leaves: flattened non-function contents from the closure,
      plus any tensors/scalars recursively extracted from nested function
      closures
    - closure_spec: TreeSpec describing how to reconstruct the closure contents
    - fn_or_stripped: either the original fn (no extraction) or a
      _StrippedClosure carrying the function parts needed for reconstruction

    Functions found among the closure leaves are recursively processed: their
    own closure tensors are extracted into the leaves list, and their skeleton
    is stored in _StrippedClosure.leaf_entries as a _FunctionLeaf.  All other
    values (tensors, scalars, None, etc.) remain as extracted leaves.

    If fn is not a plain function, has no closure, or has empty cells, returns
    the original function unchanged with no closure leaves.

    Skipped under Dynamo tracing (torch.compiler.is_compiling) because Dynamo
    can't trace through closure cell introspection and handles freevars via its
    own lifting mechanism.
