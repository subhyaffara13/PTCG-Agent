def forward_diff(tf, sample_per):
    r"""
    Returns falling coefficients of H(z) from numerator and denominator.

    Explanation
    ===========

    Where H(z) is the corresponding discretized transfer function,
    discretized with the forward difference transform method.
    H(z) is obtained from the continuous transfer function H(s)
    by substituting $s(z) = \frac{z-1}{T}$ into H(s), where T is the
    sample period.
    Coefficients are falling, i.e. $H(z) = \frac{az+b}{cz+d}$ is returned
    as [a, b], [c, d].

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.physics.control.lti import TransferFunction, forward_diff
    >>> from sympy.abc import s, L, R, T

    >>> tf = TransferFunction(1, s*L + R, s)
    >>> numZ, denZ = forward_diff(tf, T)
    >>> numZ
    [T/L]
    >>> denZ
    [1, (-L + R*T)/L]
