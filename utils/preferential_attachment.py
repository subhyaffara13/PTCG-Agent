def preferential_attachment(G, ebunch=None):
    r"""Compute the preferential attachment score of all node pairs in ebunch.

    Preferential attachment score of `u` and `v` is defined as

    .. math::

        |\Gamma(u)| |\Gamma(v)|

    where $\Gamma(u)$ denotes the set of neighbors of $u$.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
        NetworkX undirected graph.

    ebunch : iterable of node pairs, optional (default = None)
        Preferential attachment score will be computed for each pair of
        nodes given in the iterable. The pairs must be given as
        2-tuples (u, v) where u and v are nodes in the graph. If ebunch
        is None then all nonexistent edges in the graph will be used.
        Default value: None.

    Returns
    -------
    piter : iterator
        An iterator of 3-tuples in the form (u, v, p) where (u, v) is a
        pair of nodes and p is their preferential attachment score.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXNotImplemented
        If `G` is a `DiGraph`, a `Multigraph` or a `MultiDiGraph`.

    NodeNotFound
        If `ebunch` has a node that is not in `G`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.complete_graph(5)
    >>> preds = nx.preferential_attachment(G, [(0, 1), (2, 3)])
    >>> for u, v, p in preds:
    ...     print(f"({u}, {v}) -> {p}")
    (0, 1) -> 16
    (2, 3) -> 16
