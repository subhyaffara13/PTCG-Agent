    Tests the ascent method using a truly asymmetric graph with a fractional
    solution for which the solution has been brute forced.

    In this graph their are two different optimal, integral solutions (which
    are also the overall atsp solutions) to the Held Karp relaxation. However,
    this particular graph has two different tours of optimal value and the
    possible solutions in the held_karp_ascent function are not stored in an
    ordered data structure.
