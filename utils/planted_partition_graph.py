def planted_partition_graph(l, k, p_in, p_out, seed=None, directed=False):
    """Returns the planted l-partition graph.

    This model partitions a graph with n=l*k vertices in
    l groups with k vertices each. Vertices of the same
    group are linked with a probability p_in, and vertices
    of different groups are linked with probability p_out.

    Parameters
    ----------
    l : int
      Number of groups
    k : int
      Number of vertices in each group
    p_in : float
      probability of connecting vertices within a group
    p_out : float
      probability of connected vertices between groups
    seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
        Indicator of random number generation state.
        See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.
    directed : bool,optional (default=False)
      If True return a directed graph

    Returns
    -------
    G : NetworkX Graph or DiGraph
      planted l-partition graph

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
      If `p_in`, `p_out` are not in `[0, 1]`

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.planted_partition_graph(4, 3, 0.5, 0.1, seed=42)
