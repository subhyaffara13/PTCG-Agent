def necklaces(n, k, free=False):
    """
    A routine to generate necklaces that may (free=True) or may not
    (free=False) be turned over to be viewed. The "necklaces" returned
    are comprised of ``n`` integers (beads) with ``k`` different
    values (colors). Only unique necklaces are returned.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.utilities.iterables import necklaces, bracelets
    >>> def show(s, i):
    ...     return ''.join(s[j] for j in i)

    The "unrestricted necklace" is sometimes also referred to as a
    "bracelet" (an object that can be turned over, a sequence that can
    be reversed) and the term "necklace" is used to imply a sequence
    that cannot be reversed. So ACB == ABC for a bracelet (rotate and
    reverse) while the two are different for a necklace since rotation
    alone cannot make the two sequences the same.

    (mnemonic: Bracelets can be viewed Backwards, but Not Necklaces.)

    >>> B = [show('ABC', i) for i in bracelets(3, 3)]
    >>> N = [show('ABC', i) for i in necklaces(3, 3)]
    >>> set(N) - set(B)
    {'ACB'}

    >>> list(necklaces(4, 2))
    [(0, 0, 0, 0), (0, 0, 0, 1), (0, 0, 1, 1),
     (0, 1, 0, 1), (0, 1, 1, 1), (1, 1, 1, 1)]

    >>> [show('.o', i) for i in bracelets(4, 2)]
    ['....', '...o', '..oo', '.o.o', '.ooo', 'oooo']
