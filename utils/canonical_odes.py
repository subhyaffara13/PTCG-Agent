def canonical_odes(eqs, funcs, t):
    r"""
    Function that solves for highest order derivatives in a system

    Explanation
    ===========

    This function inputs a system of ODEs and based on the system,
    the dependent variables and their highest order, returns the system
    in the following form:

    .. math::
        X'(t) = A(t) X(t) + b(t)

    Here, $X(t)$ is the vector of dependent variables of lower order, $A(t)$ is
    the coefficient matrix, $b(t)$ is the non-homogeneous term and $X'(t)$ is the
    vector of dependent variables in their respective highest order. We use the term
    canonical form to imply the system of ODEs which is of the above form.

    If the system passed has a non-linear term with multiple solutions, then a list of
    systems is returned in its canonical form.

    Parameters
    ==========

    eqs : List
        List of the ODEs
    funcs : List
        List of dependent variables
    t : Symbol
        Independent variable

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import symbols, Function, Eq, Derivative
    >>> from sympy.solvers.ode.systems import canonical_odes
    >>> f, g = symbols("f g", cls=Function)
    >>> x, y = symbols("x y")
    >>> funcs = [f(x), g(x)]
    >>> eqs = [Eq(f(x).diff(x) - 7*f(x), 12*g(x)), Eq(g(x).diff(x) + g(x), 20*f(x))]

    >>> canonical_eqs = canonical_odes(eqs, funcs, x)
    >>> canonical_eqs
    [[Eq(Derivative(f(x), x), 7*f(x) + 12*g(x)), Eq(Derivative(g(x), x), 20*f(x) - g(x))]]

    >>> system = [Eq(Derivative(f(x), x)**2 - 2*Derivative(f(x), x) + 1, 4), Eq(-y*f(x) + Derivative(g(x), x), 0)]

    >>> canonical_system = canonical_odes(system, funcs, x)
    >>> canonical_system
    [[Eq(Derivative(f(x), x), -1), Eq(Derivative(g(x), x), y*f(x))], [Eq(Derivative(f(x), x), 3), Eq(Derivative(g(x), x), y*f(x))]]

    Returns
    =======

    List
