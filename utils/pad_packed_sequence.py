    r"""Pad a packed batch of variable length sequences.

    It is an inverse operation to :func:`pack_padded_sequence`.

    The returned Tensor's data will be of size ``T x B x *`` (if :attr:`batch_first` is ``False``)
    or ``B x T x *`` (if :attr:`batch_first` is ``True``) , where ``T`` is the length of the longest
    sequence and ``B`` is the batch size.

    Example:
        >>> from torch.nn.utils.rnn import pack_padded_sequence, pad_packed_sequence
        >>> seq = torch.tensor([[1, 2, 0], [3, 0, 0], [4, 5, 6]])
        >>> lens = [2, 1, 3]
        >>> packed = pack_padded_sequence(
        ...     seq, lens, batch_first=True, enforce_sorted=False
        ... )
        >>> packed
        PackedSequence(data=tensor([4, 1, 3, 5, 2, 6]), batch_sizes=tensor([3, 2, 1]),
                       sorted_indices=tensor([2, 0, 1]), unsorted_indices=tensor([1, 2, 0]))
        >>> seq_unpacked, lens_unpacked = pad_packed_sequence(packed, batch_first=True)
        >>> seq_unpacked
        tensor([[1, 2, 0],
                [3, 0, 0],
                [4, 5, 6]])
        >>> lens_unpacked
        tensor([2, 1, 3])

    .. note::
        :attr:`total_length` is useful to implement the
        ``pack sequence -> recurrent network -> unpack sequence`` pattern in a
        :class:`~torch.nn.Module` wrapped in :class:`~torch.nn.DataParallel`.
        See :ref:`this FAQ section <pack-rnn-unpack-with-data-parallelism>` for
        details.

    Args:
        sequence (PackedSequence): batch to pad
        batch_first (bool, optional): if ``True``, the output will be in ``B x T x *``
            format, ``T x B x *`` otherwise.
        padding_value (float, optional): values for padded elements.
        total_length (int, optional): if not ``None``, the output will be padded to
            have length :attr:`total_length`. This method will throw :class:`ValueError`
            if :attr:`total_length` is less than the max sequence length in
            :attr:`sequence`.

    Returns:
        Tuple of Tensor containing the padded sequence, and a Tensor
        containing the list of lengths of each sequence in the batch.
        Batch elements will be re-ordered as they were ordered originally when
        the batch was passed to ``pack_padded_sequence`` or ``pack_sequence``.
