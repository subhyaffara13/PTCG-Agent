def length(P, Q, D):
    r"""
    Returns the (length of aperiodic part + length of periodic part) of
    continued fraction representation of `\\frac{P + \sqrt{D}}{Q}`.

    It is important to remember that this does NOT return the length of the
    periodic part but the sum of the lengths of the two parts as mentioned
    above.

    Usage
    =====

    ``length(P, Q, D)``: ``P``, ``Q`` and ``D`` are integers corresponding to
    the continued fraction `\\frac{P + \sqrt{D}}{Q}`.

    Details
    =======

    ``P``, ``D`` and ``Q`` corresponds to P, D and Q in the continued fraction,
    `\\frac{P + \sqrt{D}}{Q}`.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.solvers.diophantine.diophantine import length
    >>> length(-2, 4, 5) # (-2 + sqrt(5))/4
    3
    >>> length(-5, 4, 17) # (-5 + sqrt(17))/4
    4
