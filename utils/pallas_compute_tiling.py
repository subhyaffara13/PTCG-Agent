    Always uses TPU-compatible alignment (last dim multiple of 128,
    second-to-last multiple of 8) so that the same generated kernel works
    on both CPU-interpret and real TPU.

    *transpose* constrains tile sizes to keep VMEM usage within safe
    limits for pallas_permute (gather-based permutation).

    *skip_last_n* prevents tiling the last N dimensions (used when those
    dims correspond to internal reduction ranges that must remain full).

    *exact_only* restricts tiling to dimensions that divide evenly by the
    tile size (no remainder blocks).  Required on TPU where Mosaic needs
    block shapes to match the XLA memory layout.

    Returns ``(tile_shape, grid, axis_to_grid)`` where *axis_to_grid*
    maps each tiled reference-shape axis index to its position in the
    grid tuple.

    When no dimension benefits from tiling the grid is ``(1,)`` and the
    tile covers the full tensor.
