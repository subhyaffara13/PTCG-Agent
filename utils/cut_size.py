def cut_size(G, S, T=None, weight=None):
    """Returns the size of the cut between two sets of nodes.

    A *cut* is a partition of the nodes of a graph into two sets. The
    *cut size* is the sum of the weights of the edges "between" the two
    sets of nodes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    S : collection
        A collection of nodes in `G`.

    T : collection
        A collection of nodes in `G`. If not specified, this is taken to
        be the set complement of `S`.

    weight : object
        Edge attribute key to use as weight. If not specified, edges
        have weight one.

    Returns
    -------
    number
        Total weight of all edges from nodes in set `S` to nodes in
        set `T` (and, in the case of directed graphs, all edges from
        nodes in `T` to nodes in `S`).

    Examples
    --------
    In the graph with two cliques joined by a single edges, the natural
    bipartition of the graph into two blocks, one for each clique,
    yields a cut of weight one:

    >>> G = nx.barbell_graph(3, 0)
    >>> S = {0, 1, 2}
    >>> T = {3, 4, 5}
    >>> nx.cut_size(G, S, T)
    1

    Each parallel edge in a multigraph is counted when determining the
    cut size:

    >>> G = nx.MultiGraph(["ab", "ab"])
    >>> S = {"a"}
    >>> T = {"b"}
    >>> nx.cut_size(G, S, T)
    2

    Notes
    -----
    In a multigraph, the cut size is the total weight of edges including
    multiplicity.

    """
    edges = nx.edge_boundary(G, S, T, data=weight, default=1)
    if G.is_directed():
        edges = chain(edges, nx.edge_boundary(G, T, S, data=weight, default=1))
    return sum(weight for u, v, weight in edges)
