    r"""Compute the trophic incoherence parameter of a graph.

    Trophic coherence is defined as the homogeneity of the distribution of
    trophic distances: the more similar, the more coherent. This is measured by
    the standard deviation of the trophic differences and referred to as the
    trophic incoherence parameter $q$ by [1].

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : DiGraph
        A directed networkx graph

    cannibalism: Boolean
        If set to False, self edges are not considered in the calculation

    Returns
    -------
    trophic_incoherence_parameter : float
        The trophic coherence of a graph
