    r"""
    Load data from a text file.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fname : file, str, pathlib.Path, list of str, generator
        File, filename, list, or generator to read.  If the filename
        extension is ``.gz`` or ``.bz2``, the file is first decompressed. Note
        that generators must return bytes or strings. The strings
        in a list or produced by a generator are treated as lines.
    dtype : data-type, optional
        Data-type of the resulting array; default: float.  If this is a
        structured data-type, the resulting array will be 1-dimensional, and
        each row will be interpreted as an element of the array.  In this
        case, the number of columns used must match the number of fields in
        the data-type.
    comments : str or sequence of str or None, optional
        The characters or list of characters used to indicate the start of a
        comment. None implies no comments. For backwards compatibility, byte
        strings will be decoded as 'latin1'. The default is '#'.
    delimiter : str, optional
        The character used to separate the values. For backwards compatibility,
        byte strings will be decoded as 'latin1'. The default is whitespace.

        .. versionchanged:: 1.23.0
           Only single character delimiters are supported. Newline characters
           cannot be used as the delimiter.

    converters : dict or callable, optional
        Converter functions to customize value parsing. If `converters` is
        callable, the function is applied to all columns, else it must be a
        dict that maps column number to a parser function.
        See examples for further details.
        Default: None.

        .. versionchanged:: 1.23.0
           The ability to pass a single callable to be applied to all columns
           was added.

    skiprows : int, optional
        Skip the first `skiprows` lines, including comments; default: 0.
    usecols : int or sequence, optional
        Which columns to read, with 0 being the first. For example,
        ``usecols = (1,4,5)`` will extract the 2nd, 5th and 6th columns.
        The default, None, results in all columns being read.
    unpack : bool, optional
        If True, the returned array is transposed, so that arguments may be
        unpacked using ``x, y, z = loadtxt(...)``.  When used with a
        structured data-type, arrays are returned for each field.
        Default is False.
    ndmin : int, optional
        The returned array will have at least `ndmin` dimensions.
        Otherwise mono-dimensional axes will be squeezed.
        Legal values: 0 (default), 1 or 2.
    encoding : str, optional
        Encoding used to decode the inputfile. Does not apply to input streams.
        The special value 'bytes' enables backward compatibility workarounds
        that ensures you receive byte arrays as results if possible and passes
        'latin1' encoded strings to converters. Override this value to receive
        unicode arrays and pass strings as input to converters.  If set to None
        the system default is used. The default value is None.

        .. versionchanged:: 2.0
            Before NumPy 2, the default was ``'bytes'`` for Python 2
            compatibility. The default is now ``None``.

    max_rows : int, optional
        Read `max_rows` rows of content after `skiprows` lines. The default is
        to read all the rows. Note that empty rows containing no data such as
        empty lines and comment lines are not counted towards `max_rows`,
        while such lines are counted in `skiprows`.

        .. versionchanged:: 1.23.0
            Lines containing no data, including comment lines (e.g., lines
            starting with '#' or as specified via `comments`) are not counted
            towards `max_rows`.
    quotechar : unicode character or None, optional
        The character used to denote the start and end of a quoted item.
        Occurrences of the delimiter or comment characters are ignored within
        a quoted item. The default value is ``quotechar=None``, which means
        quoting support is disabled.

        If two consecutive instances of `quotechar` are found within a quoted
        field, the first is treated as an escape character. See examples.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Data read from the text file.

    See Also
    --------
    load, fromstring, fromregex
    genfromtxt : Load data with missing values handled as specified.
    scipy.io.loadmat : reads MATLAB data files

    Notes
    -----
    This function aims to be a fast reader for simply formatted files.  The
    `genfromtxt` function provides more sophisticated handling of, e.g.,
    lines with missing values.

    Each row in the input text file must have the same number of values to be
    able to read all values. If all rows do not have same number of values, a
    subset of up to n columns (where n is the least number of values present
    in all rows) can be read by specifying the columns via `usecols`.

    The strings produced by the Python float.hex method can be used as
    input for floats.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from io import StringIO   # StringIO behaves like a file object
    >>> c = StringIO("0 1\n2 3")
    >>> np.loadtxt(c)
    array([[0., 1.],
           [2., 3.]])

    >>> d = StringIO("M 21 72\nF 35 58")
    >>> np.loadtxt(d, dtype={'names': ('gender', 'age', 'weight'),
    ...                      'formats': ('S1', 'i4', 'f4')})
    array([(b'M', 21, 72.), (b'F', 35, 58.)],
          dtype=[('gender', 'S1'), ('age', '<i4'), ('weight', '<f4')])

    >>> c = StringIO("1,0,2\n3,0,4")
    >>> x, y = np.loadtxt(c, delimiter=',', usecols=(0, 2), unpack=True)
    >>> x
    array([1., 3.])
    >>> y
    array([2., 4.])

    The `converters` argument is used to specify functions to preprocess the
    text prior to parsing. `converters` can be a dictionary that maps
    preprocessing functions to each column:

    >>> s = StringIO("1.618, 2.296\n3.141, 4.669\n")
    >>> conv = {
    ...     0: lambda x: np.floor(float(x)),  # conversion fn for column 0
    ...     1: lambda x: np.ceil(float(x)),  # conversion fn for column 1
    ... }
    >>> np.loadtxt(s, delimiter=",", converters=conv)
    array([[1., 3.],
           [3., 5.]])

    `converters` can be a callable instead of a dictionary, in which case it
    is applied to all columns:

    >>> s = StringIO("0xDE 0xAD\n0xC0 0xDE")
    >>> import functools
    >>> conv = functools.partial(int, base=16)
    >>> np.loadtxt(s, converters=conv)
    array([[222., 173.],
           [192., 222.]])

    This example shows how `converters` can be used to convert a field
    with a trailing minus sign into a negative number.

    >>> s = StringIO("10.01 31.25-\n19.22 64.31\n17.57- 63.94")
    >>> def conv(fld):
    ...     return -float(fld[:-1]) if fld.endswith("-") else float(fld)
    ...
    >>> np.loadtxt(s, converters=conv)
    array([[ 10.01, -31.25],
           [ 19.22,  64.31],
           [-17.57,  63.94]])

    Using a callable as the converter can be particularly useful for handling
    values with different formatting, e.g. floats with underscores:

    >>> s = StringIO("1 2.7 100_000")
    >>> np.loadtxt(s, converters=float)
    array([1.e+00, 2.7e+00, 1.e+05])

    This idea can be extended to automatically handle values specified in
    many different formats, such as hex values:

    >>> def conv(val):
    ...     try:
    ...         return float(val)
    ...     except ValueError:
    ...         return float.fromhex(val)
    >>> s = StringIO("1, 2.5, 3_000, 0b4, 0x1.4000000000000p+2")
    >>> np.loadtxt(s, delimiter=",", converters=conv)
    array([1.0e+00, 2.5e+00, 3.0e+03, 1.8e+02, 5.0e+00])

    Or a format where the ``-`` sign comes after the number:

    >>> s = StringIO("10.01 31.25-\n19.22 64.31\n17.57- 63.94")
    >>> conv = lambda x: -float(x[:-1]) if x.endswith("-") else float(x)
    >>> np.loadtxt(s, converters=conv)
    array([[ 10.01, -31.25],
           [ 19.22,  64.31],
           [-17.57,  63.94]])

    Support for quoted fields is enabled with the `quotechar` parameter.
    Comment and delimiter characters are ignored when they appear within a
    quoted item delineated by `quotechar`:

    >>> s = StringIO('"alpha, #42", 10.0\n"beta, #64", 2.0\n')
    >>> dtype = np.dtype([("label", "U12"), ("value", float)])
    >>> np.loadtxt(s, dtype=dtype, delimiter=",", quotechar='"')
    array([('alpha, #42', 10.), ('beta, #64',  2.)],
          dtype=[('label', '<U12'), ('value', '<f8')])

    Quoted fields can be separated by multiple whitespace characters:

    >>> s = StringIO('"alpha, #42"       10.0\n"beta, #64" 2.0\n')
    >>> dtype = np.dtype([("label", "U12"), ("value", float)])
    >>> np.loadtxt(s, dtype=dtype, delimiter=None, quotechar='"')
    array([('alpha, #42', 10.), ('beta, #64',  2.)],
          dtype=[('label', '<U12'), ('value', '<f8')])

    Two consecutive quote characters within a quoted field are treated as a
    single escaped character:

    >>> s = StringIO('"Hello, my name is ""Monty""!"')
    >>> np.loadtxt(s, dtype=np.str_, delimiter=",", quotechar='"')
    array('Hello, my name is "Monty"!', dtype='<U26')

    Read subset of columns when all rows do not contain equal number of values:

    >>> d = StringIO("1 2\n2 4\n3 9 12\n4 16 20")
    >>> np.loadtxt(d, usecols=(0, 1))
    array([[ 1.,  2.],
           [ 2.,  4.],
           [ 3.,  9.],
           [ 4., 16.]])
