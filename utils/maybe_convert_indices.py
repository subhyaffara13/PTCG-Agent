def maybe_convert_indices(indices, n: int, verify: bool = True) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Attempt to convert indices into valid, positive indices.

    If we have negative indices, translate to positive here.
    If we have indices that are out-of-bounds, raise an IndexError.

    Parameters
    ----------
    indices : array-like
        Array of indices that we are to convert.
    n : int
        Number of elements in the array that we are indexing.
    verify : bool, default True
        Check that all entries are between 0 and n - 1, inclusive.

    Returns
    -------
    array-like
        An array-like of positive indices that correspond to the ones
        that were passed in initially to this function.

    Raises
    ------
    IndexError
        One of the converted indices either exceeded the number of,
        elements (specified by `n`), or was still negative.
