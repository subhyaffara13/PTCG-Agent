    r"""Asserts that ``actual`` and ``expected`` are close.

    If ``actual`` and ``expected`` are strided, non-quantized, real-valued, and finite, they are considered close if

    .. math::

        \lvert \text{actual} - \text{expected} \rvert \le \texttt{atol} + \texttt{rtol} \cdot \lvert \text{expected} \rvert

    Non-finite values (``-inf`` and ``inf``) are only considered close if and only if they are equal. ``NaN``'s are
    only considered equal to each other if ``equal_nan`` is ``True``.

    In addition, they are only considered close if they have the same

    - :attr:`~torch.Tensor.device` (if ``check_device`` is ``True``),
    - ``dtype`` (if ``check_dtype`` is ``True``),
    - ``layout`` (if ``check_layout`` is ``True``), and
    - stride (if ``check_stride`` is ``True``).

    If either ``actual`` or ``expected`` is a meta tensor, only the attribute checks will be performed.

    If ``actual`` and ``expected`` are sparse (either having COO, CSR, CSC, BSR, or BSC layout), their strided members are
    checked individually. Indices, namely ``indices`` for COO, ``crow_indices`` and ``col_indices`` for CSR and BSR,
    or ``ccol_indices``  and ``row_indices`` for CSC and BSC layouts, respectively,
    are always checked for equality whereas the values are checked for closeness according to the definition above.

    If ``actual`` and ``expected`` are quantized, they are considered close if they have the same
    :meth:`~torch.Tensor.qscheme` and the result of :meth:`~torch.Tensor.dequantize` is close according to the
    definition above.

    ``actual`` and ``expected`` can be :class:`~torch.Tensor`'s or any tensor-or-scalar-likes from which
    :class:`torch.Tensor`'s can be constructed with :func:`torch.as_tensor`. Except for Python scalars the input types
    have to be directly related. In addition, ``actual`` and ``expected`` can be :class:`~collections.abc.Sequence`'s
    or :class:`~collections.abc.Mapping`'s in which case they are considered close if their structure matches and all
    their elements are considered close according to the above definition.

    .. note::

        Python scalars are an exception to the type relation requirement, because their :func:`type`, i.e.
        :class:`int`, :class:`float`, and :class:`complex`, is equivalent to the ``dtype`` of a tensor-like. Thus,
        Python scalars of different types can be checked, but require ``check_dtype=False``.

    Args:
        actual (Any): Actual input.
        expected (Any): Expected input.
        allow_subclasses (bool): If ``True`` (default) and except for Python scalars, inputs of directly related types
            are allowed. Otherwise type equality is required.
        rtol (Optional[float]): Relative tolerance. If specified ``atol`` must also be specified. If omitted, default
            values based on the :attr:`~torch.Tensor.dtype` are selected with the below table.
        atol (Optional[float]): Absolute tolerance. If specified ``rtol`` must also be specified. If omitted, default
            values based on the :attr:`~torch.Tensor.dtype` are selected with the below table.
        equal_nan (Union[bool, str]): If ``True``, two ``NaN`` values will be considered equal.
        check_device (bool): If ``True`` (default), asserts that corresponding tensors are on the same
            :attr:`~torch.Tensor.device`. If this check is disabled, tensors on different
            :attr:`~torch.Tensor.device`'s are moved to the CPU before being compared.
        check_dtype (bool): If ``True`` (default), asserts that corresponding tensors have the same ``dtype``. If this
            check is disabled, tensors with different ``dtype``'s are promoted  to a common ``dtype`` (according to
            :func:`torch.promote_types`) before being compared.
        check_layout (bool): If ``True`` (default), asserts that corresponding tensors have the same ``layout``. If this
            check is disabled, tensors with different ``layout``'s are converted to strided tensors before being
            compared.
        check_stride (bool): If ``True`` and corresponding tensors are strided, asserts that they have the same stride.
        msg (Optional[Union[str, Callable[[str], str]]]): Optional error message to use in case a failure occurs during
            the comparison. Can also passed as callable in which case it will be called with the generated message and
            should return the new message.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If no :class:`torch.Tensor` can be constructed from an input.
        ValueError: If only ``rtol`` or ``atol`` is specified.
        AssertionError: If corresponding inputs are not Python scalars and are not directly related.
        AssertionError: If ``allow_subclasses`` is ``False``, but corresponding inputs are not Python scalars and have
            different types.
        AssertionError: If the inputs are :class:`~collections.abc.Sequence`'s, but their length does not match.
        AssertionError: If the inputs are :class:`~collections.abc.Mapping`'s, but their set of keys do not match.
        AssertionError: If corresponding tensors do not have the same :attr:`~torch.Tensor.shape`.
        AssertionError: If ``check_layout`` is ``True``, but corresponding tensors do not have the same
            :attr:`~torch.Tensor.layout`.
        AssertionError: If only one of corresponding tensors is quantized.
        AssertionError: If corresponding tensors are quantized, but have different :meth:`~torch.Tensor.qscheme`'s.
        AssertionError: If ``check_device`` is ``True``, but corresponding tensors are not on the same
            :attr:`~torch.Tensor.device`.
        AssertionError: If ``check_dtype`` is ``True``, but corresponding tensors do not have the same ``dtype``.
        AssertionError: If ``check_stride`` is ``True``, but corresponding strided tensors do not have the same stride.
        AssertionError: If the values of corresponding tensors are not close according to the definition above.

    The following table displays the default ``rtol`` and ``atol`` for different ``dtype``'s. In case of mismatching
    ``dtype``'s, the maximum of both tolerances is used.

    .. note::

        :func:`~torch.testing.assert_close` is highly configurable with strict default settings. Users are encouraged
        to :func:`~functools.partial` it to fit their use case. For example, if an equality check is needed, one might
        define an ``assert_equal`` that uses zero tolerances for every ``dtype`` by default:

        >>> import functools
        >>> assert_equal = functools.partial(torch.testing.assert_close, rtol=0, atol=0)
        >>> assert_equal(1e-9, 1e-10)
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
        AssertionError: Scalars are not equal!
