    For element-wise operations and handles broadcasting.
    Note that after applying broadcasting to the arguments
    we are able to determine if certain dimensions have not been broadcast
    if they are symbolicallu equal.

    in this case, we can establish equality between those dimensions and the
    corresponding output dimensions.

    Note that it takes two iterations for this result. One iteration to establish
    equality between certain dimensions of the operands (requiring the whole solver
    including unification) and another iteration to establish equality between the operands
    and the resulting type, requiring another round of constraint generation and unificaiton.
