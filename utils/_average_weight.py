      A networkx graph.

    path: list
      A list of vertices that define the path.

      If None, edge weights are ignored.  Then the average weight of an edge
      is assumed to be the multiplicative inverse of the length of the path.
      Otherwise holds the name of the edge attribute used as weight.
