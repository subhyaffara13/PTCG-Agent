def truncated_tetrahedron_graph(create_using=None):
    """
    Returns the skeleton of the truncated Platonic tetrahedron.

    The truncated tetrahedron is an Archimedean solid with 4 regular hexagonal faces,
    4 equilateral triangle faces, 12 nodes and 18 edges. It can be constructed by truncating
    all 4 vertices of a regular tetrahedron at one third of the original edge length [1]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    create_using : NetworkX graph constructor, optional (default=nx.Graph)
       Graph type to create. If graph instance, then cleared before populated.

    Returns
    -------
    G : networkx Graph
        Skeleton of the truncated tetrahedron
