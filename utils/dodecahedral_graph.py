def dodecahedral_graph(create_using=None):
    """
    Returns the Platonic Dodecahedral graph.

    The dodecahedral graph has 20 nodes and 30 edges. The skeleton of the
    dodecahedron forms a graph. It is one of 5 Platonic graphs [1]_.
    It can be described in LCF notation as:
    ``[10, 7, 4, -4, -7, 10, -4, 7, -7, 4]^2`` [2]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    create_using : NetworkX graph constructor, optional (default=nx.Graph)
       Graph type to create. If graph instance, then cleared before populated.

    Returns
    -------
    G : networkx Graph
        Dodecahedral Graph with 20 nodes and 30 edges
