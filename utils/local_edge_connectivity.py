def local_edge_connectivity(
    G, s, t, flow_func=None, auxiliary=None, residual=None, cutoff=None
):
    r"""Returns local edge connectivity for nodes s and t in G.

    Local edge connectivity for two nodes s and t is the minimum number
    of edges that must be removed to disconnect them.

    This is a flow based implementation of edge connectivity. We compute the
    maximum flow on an auxiliary digraph build from the original
    network (see below for details). This is equal to the local edge
    connectivity because the value of a maximum s-t-flow is equal to the
    capacity of a minimum s-t-cut (Ford and Fulkerson theorem) [1]_ .

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
        Undirected or directed graph

    s : node
        Source node

    t : node
        Target node

    flow_func : function
        A function for computing the maximum flow among a pair of nodes.
        The function has to accept at least three parameters: a Digraph,
        a source node, and a target node. And return a residual network
        that follows NetworkX conventions (see :meth:`maximum_flow` for
        details). If flow_func is None, the default maximum flow function
        (:meth:`edmonds_karp`) is used. See below for details. The
        choice of the default function may change from version
        to version and should not be relied on. Default value: None.

    auxiliary : NetworkX DiGraph
        Auxiliary digraph for computing flow based edge connectivity. If
        provided it will be reused instead of recreated. Default value: None.

    residual : NetworkX DiGraph
        Residual network to compute maximum flow. If provided it will be
        reused instead of recreated. Default value: None.

    cutoff : integer, float, or None (default: None)
        If specified, the maximum flow algorithm will terminate when the
        flow value reaches or exceeds the cutoff. This only works for flows
        that support the cutoff parameter (most do) and is ignored otherwise.

    Returns
    -------
    K : integer
        local edge connectivity for nodes s and t.

    Examples
    --------
    This function is not imported in the base NetworkX namespace, so you
    have to explicitly import it from the connectivity package:

    >>> from networkx.algorithms.connectivity import local_edge_connectivity

    We use in this example the platonic icosahedral graph, which has edge
    connectivity 5.

    >>> G = nx.icosahedral_graph()
    >>> local_edge_connectivity(G, 0, 6)
    5

    If you need to compute local connectivity on several pairs of
    nodes in the same graph, it is recommended that you reuse the
    data structures that NetworkX uses in the computation: the
    auxiliary digraph for edge connectivity, and the residual
    network for the underlying maximum flow computation.

    Example of how to compute local edge connectivity among
    all pairs of nodes of the platonic icosahedral graph reusing
    the data structures.

    >>> import itertools
    >>> # You also have to explicitly import the function for
    >>> # building the auxiliary digraph from the connectivity package
    >>> from networkx.algorithms.connectivity import build_auxiliary_edge_connectivity
    >>> H = build_auxiliary_edge_connectivity(G)
    >>> # And the function for building the residual network from the
    >>> # flow package
    >>> from networkx.algorithms.flow import build_residual_network
    >>> # Note that the auxiliary digraph has an edge attribute named capacity
    >>> R = build_residual_network(H, "capacity")
    >>> result = dict.fromkeys(G, dict())
    >>> # Reuse the auxiliary digraph and the residual network by passing them
    >>> # as parameters
    >>> for u, v in itertools.combinations(G, 2):
    ...     k = local_edge_connectivity(G, u, v, auxiliary=H, residual=R)
    ...     result[u][v] = k
    >>> all(result[u][v] == 5 for u, v in itertools.combinations(G, 2))
    True

    You can also use alternative flow algorithms for computing edge
    connectivity. For instance, in dense networks the algorithm
    :meth:`shortest_augmenting_path` will usually perform better than
    the default :meth:`edmonds_karp` which is faster for sparse
    networks with highly skewed degree distributions. Alternative flow
    functions have to be explicitly imported from the flow package.

    >>> from networkx.algorithms.flow import shortest_augmenting_path
    >>> local_edge_connectivity(G, 0, 6, flow_func=shortest_augmenting_path)
    5

    Notes
    -----
    This is a flow based implementation of edge connectivity. We compute the
    maximum flow using, by default, the :meth:`edmonds_karp` algorithm on an
    auxiliary digraph build from the original input graph:

    If the input graph is undirected, we replace each edge (`u`,`v`) with
    two reciprocal arcs (`u`, `v`) and (`v`, `u`) and then we set the attribute
    'capacity' for each arc to 1. If the input graph is directed we simply
    add the 'capacity' attribute. This is an implementation of algorithm 1
    in [1]_.

    The maximum flow in the auxiliary network is equal to the local edge
    connectivity because the value of a maximum s-t-flow is equal to the
    capacity of a minimum s-t-cut (Ford and Fulkerson theorem).
