def _get_aligned_offsets(yspans, height, align="baseline"):
    """
    Align boxes each specified by their ``(y0, y1)`` spans.

    For simplicity of the description, the terminology used here assumes a
    horizontal layout (i.e., vertical alignment), but the function works
    equally for a vertical layout.

    Parameters
    ----------
    yspans
        List of (y0, y1) spans of boxes to be aligned.
    height : float or None
        Intended total height. If None, the maximum of the heights
        (``y1 - y0``) in *yspans* is used.
    align : {'baseline', 'left', 'top', 'right', 'bottom', 'center'}
        The alignment anchor of the boxes.

    Returns
    -------
    (y0, y1)
        y range spanned by the packing.  If a *height* was originally passed
        in, then for all alignments other than "baseline", a span of ``(0,
        height)`` is used without checking that it is actually large enough).
    descent
        The descent of the packing.
    offsets
        The bottom offsets of the boxes.
