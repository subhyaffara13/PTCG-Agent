def sdm_spoly(f, g, O, K, phantom=None):
    """
    Compute the generalized s-polynomial of ``f`` and ``g``.

    The ground field is assumed to be ``K``, and monomials ordered according to
    ``O``.

    This is invalid if either of ``f`` or ``g`` is zero.

    If the leading terms of `f` and `g` involve different basis elements of
    `F`, their s-poly is defined to be zero. Otherwise it is a certain linear
    combination of `f` and `g` in which the leading terms cancel.
    See [SCA, defn 2.3.6] for details.

    If ``phantom`` is not ``None``, it should be a pair of module elements on
    which to perform the same operation(s) as on ``f`` and ``g``. The in this
    case both results are returned.
