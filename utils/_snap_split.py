def _snap_split(groups, neighbor_info, group_lookup, group_id):
    """
    Splits a group based on edge types and updates the groups accordingly

    Splits the group with the given group_id based on the edge types
    of the nodes so that each new grouping will all have the same
    edges with other nodes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    groups: dict
        A dictionary of unique group IDs and their corresponding node groups
    neighbor_info: dict
        A data structure indicating the number of edges a node has with the
        groups in the current summarization of each edge type
    edge_types: dict
        dictionary of edges in the graph and their corresponding attributes recognized
        in the summarization
    group_lookup: dict
        dictionary of nodes and their current corresponding group ID
    group_id: object
        ID of group to be split

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        The updated groups based on the split
