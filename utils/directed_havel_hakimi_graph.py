    """Returns a directed graph with the given degree sequences.

    Parameters
    ----------
    in_deg_sequence :  list of integers
        Each list entry corresponds to the in-degree of a node.
    out_deg_sequence : list of integers
        Each list entry corresponds to the out-degree of a node.
    create_using : NetworkX graph constructor, optional (default DiGraph)
        Graph type to create. If graph instance, then cleared before populated.

    Returns
    -------
    G : DiGraph
        A graph with the specified degree sequences.
        Nodes are labeled starting at 0 with an index
        corresponding to the position in deg_sequence

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        If the degree sequences are not digraphical.

    --------

    Notes
    -----
    Algorithm as described by Kleitman and Wang [1]_.
