def divisors(n, generator=False, proper=False):
    r"""
    Return all divisors of n sorted from 1..n by default.
    If generator is ``True`` an unordered generator is returned.

    The number of divisors of n can be quite large if there are many
    prime factors (counting repeated factors). If only the number of
    factors is desired use divisor_count(n).

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import divisors, divisor_count
    >>> divisors(24)
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24]
    >>> divisor_count(24)
    8

    >>> list(divisors(120, generator=True))
    [1, 2, 4, 8, 3, 6, 12, 24, 5, 10, 20, 40, 15, 30, 60, 120]
