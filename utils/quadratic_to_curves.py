    """Converts a connecting list of quadratic splines to a list of quadratic
    and cubic curves.

    A quadratic spline is specified as a list of points.  Either each point is
    a 2-tuple of X,Y coordinates, or each point is a complex number with
    real/imaginary components representing X,Y coordinates.

    The first and last points are on-curve points and the rest are off-curve
    points, with an implied on-curve point in the middle between every two
    consequtive off-curve points.

    Returns:
        The output is a list of tuples of points. Points are represented
        in the same format as the input, either as 2-tuples or complex numbers.
        If ``quads`` is empty, returns an empty list.

        Each tuple is either of length three, for a quadratic curve, or four,
        for a cubic curve.  Each curve's last point is the same as the next
        curve's first point.

    Args:
        quads: quadratic splines

        max_err: absolute error tolerance; defaults to 0.5

        all_cubic: if True, only cubic curves are generated; defaults to False

    Raises:
        ValueError: if an input spline has fewer than 3 points, or if adjacent
        splines do not connect end-to-start.
