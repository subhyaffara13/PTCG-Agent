    Returns size, res_base, res_gens BSGS for n tensors of different types.

    Explanation
    ===========

    v is a sequence of (base_i, gens_i, free_i, sym_i)
    where
    base_i, gens_i  BSGS of tensor of type `i`
    free_i          list of the fixed slots for each of the tensors
                    of type `i`; if there are `n_i` tensors of type `i`
                    and none of them have fixed slots, `free = [[]]*n_i`
    sym   0 (1) if the tensors of type `i` (anti)commute among themselves
