    """Ensure hhea vertical metrics stay in sync with OS/2 ones after instancing.

    When applying MVAR deltas to the OS/2 table, if the ascender, descender and
    line gap change but they were the same as the respective hhea metrics in the
    original font, this context manager ensures that hhea metrcs also get updated
    accordingly.
    The MVAR spec only has tags for the OS/2 metrics, but it is common in fonts
    to have the hhea metrics be equal to those for compat reasons.
