def chordal_cycle_graph(p, create_using=None):
    """Returns the chordal cycle graph on `p` nodes.

    The returned graph is a cycle graph on `p` nodes with chords joining each
    vertex `x` to its inverse modulo `p`. This graph is a (mildly explicit)
    3-regular expander [1]_.

    `p` *must* be a prime number.

    Parameters
    ----------
    p : a prime number

        The number of vertices in the graph. This also indicates where the
        chordal edges in the cycle will be created.

    create_using : NetworkX graph constructor, optional (default=nx.Graph)
       Graph type to create. If graph instance, then cleared before populated.

    Returns
    -------
    G : graph
        The constructed undirected multigraph.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError

        If `create_using` indicates directed or not a multigraph.
