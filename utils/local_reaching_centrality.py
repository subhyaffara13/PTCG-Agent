def local_reaching_centrality(G, v, paths=None, weight=None, normalized=True):
    """Returns the local reaching centrality of a node in a directed
    graph.

    The *local reaching centrality* of a node in a directed graph is the
    proportion of other nodes reachable from that node [1]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : DiGraph
        A NetworkX DiGraph.

    v : node
        A node in the directed graph `G`.

    paths : dictionary (default=None)
        If this is not `None` it must be a dictionary representation
        of single-source shortest paths, as computed by, for example,
        :func:`networkx.shortest_path` with source node `v`. Use this
        keyword argument if you intend to invoke this function many
        times but don't want the paths to be recomputed each time.

    weight : None or string, optional (default=None)
        Attribute to use for edge weights.  If `None`, each edge weight
        is assumed to be one. A higher weight implies a stronger
        connection between nodes and a *shorter* path length.

    normalized : bool, optional (default=True)
        Whether to normalize the edge weights by the total sum of edge
        weights.

    Returns
    -------
    h : float
        The local reaching centrality of the node ``v`` in the graph
        ``G``.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.DiGraph()
    >>> G.add_edges_from([(1, 2), (1, 3)])
    >>> nx.local_reaching_centrality(G, 3)
    0.0
    >>> G.add_edge(3, 2)
    >>> nx.local_reaching_centrality(G, 3)
    0.5
