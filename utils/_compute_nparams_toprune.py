def _compute_nparams_toprune(amount, tensor_size):
    r"""Convert the pruning amount from a percentage to absolute value.

    Since amount can be expressed either in absolute value or as a
    percentage of the number of units/channels in a tensor, this utility
    function converts the percentage to absolute value to standardize
    the handling of pruning.

    Args:
        amount (int or float): quantity of parameters to prune.
            If float, should be between 0.0 and 1.0 and represent the
            fraction of parameters to prune. If int, it represents the
            absolute number of parameters to prune.
        tensor_size (int): absolute number of parameters in the tensor
            to prune.

    Returns:
        int: the number of units to prune in the tensor
