    r"""
    Implement PowerSGD algorithm.

    This DDP communication hook implements PowerSGD gradient compression
    algorithm described in the `paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13727>`_.
    Once gradient tensors are aggregated across all workers, this hook applies
    compression as follows:

    1. Views the input flattened 1D gradient tensor as a list of per-parameter tensors, and divides all the tensors into two groups:

        1.1 The tensors that should be compressed before allreduce, because the compression can give enough saving in bandwidth.

        1.2 Rest of the tensors will be directly allreduced without compression, including all the vector tensors (for biases).

    2. Handles uncompressed tensors:

        2.1. Allocate contiguous memory for those uncompressed tensors, and allreduces all the uncompressed tensors as a batch, without compression;

        2.2. Copies the individual uncompressed tensors from the contiguous memory back to the input tensor.

    3. Handles the tensors that should be compressed by PowerSGD compression:

        3.1. For each tensor M, creates two low-rank tensors P and Q for decomposing M,
        such that M = PQ^T, where Q is initialized from a standard normal distribution and orthogonalized;

        3.2. Computes each P in Ps, which is equal to MQ;

        3.3. Allreduces Ps as a batch;

        3.4. Orthogonalizes each P in Ps;

        3.5. Computes each Q in Qs, which is approximately equal to M^TP;

        3.6. Allreduces Qs as a batch;

        3.7. Computes each M among all the compressed tensors, which is approximately equal to PQ^T.

    Note that this communication hook enforces vanilla allreduce for the first ``state.start_powerSGD_iter`` iterations.
    This not only gives the user more control over the tradeoff between speedup and accuracy,
    but also helps abstract away some complexity of the internal optimization of DDP for future communication hook developers.

    Args:
        state (PowerSGDState): State information to configure the compression rate and support error feedback, warm start, etc.
            To tune the compression configs, mainly need to tune ``matrix_approximation_rank``, ``start_powerSGD_iter``
            and ``min_compression_rate``.
        bucket (dist.GradBucket): Bucket that stores a 1D flattened gradient tensor that batches multiple per-variable tensors.
            Note that since DDP comm hook only supports single process single device mode,
            only exactly one tensor is stored in this bucket.

    Returns:
        Future handler of the communication, which updates the gradients in place.
