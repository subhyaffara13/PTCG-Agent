    """Given combinatorial term f(k) simplify its consecutive term ratio
       i.e. f(k+1)/f(k).  The input term can be composed of functions and
       integer sequences which have equivalent representation in terms
       of gamma special function.

       Explanation
       ===========

       The algorithm performs three basic steps:

       1. Rewrite all functions in terms of gamma, if possible.

       2. Rewrite all occurrences of gamma in terms of products
          of gamma and rising factorial with integer,  absolute
          constant exponent.

       3. Perform simplification of nested fractions, powers
          and if the resulting expression is a quotient of
          polynomials, reduce their total degree.

       If f(k) is hypergeometric then as result we arrive with a
       quotient of polynomials of minimal degree. Otherwise None
       is returned.
