def lagmul(c1, c2):
    """
    Multiply one Laguerre series by another.

    Returns the product of two Laguerre series `c1` * `c2`.  The arguments
    are sequences of coefficients, from lowest order "term" to highest,
    e.g., [1,2,3] represents the series ``P_0 + 2*P_1 + 3*P_2``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c1, c2 : array_like
        1-D arrays of Laguerre series coefficients ordered from low to
        high.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        Of Laguerre series coefficients representing their product.

    See Also
    --------
    lagadd, lagsub, lagmulx, lagdiv, lagpow

    Notes
    -----
    In general, the (polynomial) product of two C-series results in terms
    that are not in the Laguerre polynomial basis set.  Thus, to express
    the product as a Laguerre series, it is necessary to "reproject" the
    product onto said basis set, which may produce "unintuitive" (but
    correct) results; see Examples section below.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial.laguerre import lagmul
    >>> lagmul([1, 2, 3], [0, 1, 2])
    array([  8., -13.,  38., -51.,  36.])
