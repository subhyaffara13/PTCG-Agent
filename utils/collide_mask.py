    """collision detection between two sprites, using masks.

    pygame.sprite.collide_mask(SpriteLeft, SpriteRight): bool

    Tests for collision between two sprites by testing if their bitmasks
    overlap. If the sprites have a "mask" attribute, that is used as the mask;
    otherwise, a mask is created from the sprite image. Intended to be passed
    as a collided callback function to the *collide functions. Sprites must
    have a "rect" and an optional "mask" attribute.

    New in pygame 1.8.0
