def imread(fname, format=None):
    """
    Read an image from a file into an array.

    .. note::

        This function exists for historical reasons.  It is recommended to
        use `PIL.Image.open` instead for loading images.

    Parameters
    ----------
    fname : str or file-like
        The image file to read: a filename, a URL or a file-like object opened
        in read-binary mode.

        Passing a URL is deprecated.  Please open the URL
        for reading and pass the result to Pillow, e.g. with
        ``np.array(PIL.Image.open(urllib.request.urlopen(url)))``.
    format : str, optional
        The image file format assumed for reading the data.  The image is
        loaded as a PNG file if *format* is set to "png", if *fname* is a path
        or opened file with a ".png" extension, or if it is a URL.  In all
        other cases, *format* is ignored and the format is auto-detected by
        `PIL.Image.open`.

    Returns
    -------
    `numpy.array`
        The image data. The returned array has shape

        - (M, N) for grayscale images.
        - (M, N, 3) for RGB images.
        - (M, N, 4) for RGBA images.

        PNG images are returned as float arrays (0-1).  All other formats are
        returned as int arrays, with a bit depth determined by the file's
        contents.
