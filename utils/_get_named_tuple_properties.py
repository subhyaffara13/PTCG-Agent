            #
            # Normally, annotations are evaluated like this (during jit.script):
            # 1. Load strings of python code into c++ and parse.
            # 2. Get annotations as strings
            # 3. Use the PythonResolver's resolution callback (rcb) to convert
            #    the string into a python object
            # 4. We call into annotations.py:ann_to_type to convert python obj
            #    from step 3 into a type that torchscript understands.
            #
            # NamedTuples are more complicated, because it has sub-types.
            # Normally, once we have the NamedTuple type object from #3,
            # we can just look at the annotation literal values and use
            # ann_to_type directly on them.
            #
            # But sometimes, users will annotate with string literals, e.g.
            #    x: 'int'

            #
            # These annotations appear in the annotation dict as ForwardRef('int').
            #
            # Then, we need to convert the string into a python object. This
            # requires having local context for custom objects or imported types.
            # rcb() is what gives us this. So, we plumb rcb through the stack so
            # it can be used in this context for the if block below.

            # FAQ:
            # - Why do we need this special handling for NamedTuple but string
            #   annotations work fine for normal types? Normally, we parse the
            #   string directly and then call rcb() directly from C++.
            # - Why not use ForwardRef._evaluate? For that, we need globals()
            #   and locals() for the local context where the NamedTuple was defined.
            #   rcb is what lets us look up into these. So, basically rcb does the
            #   hard work for us.
