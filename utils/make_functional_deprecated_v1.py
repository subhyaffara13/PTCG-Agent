    """make_functional_deprecated_v1(model) -> weights, func, weight_names

    Given an nn.Module, make_functional_deprecated_v1 extracts the state (weights)
    and returns a functional version of the model, `func`. This makes
    it so that it is possible use transforms over the parameters of
    `model`.

    `func` can be invoked as follows:
    ```
    x = torch.randn(4, 3)
    model = nn.Linear(3, 3)
    weights, func, _ = make_functional_deprecated_v1(model)
    func(weights, (x,))
    ```

    And here is an example of applying the grad transform:
    ```
    x = torch.randn(4, 3)
    model = nn.Linear(3, 3)
    weights, _, func = make_functional_deprecated_v1(model)
    grad_weights = grad(func)(weights, (x,))
    ```

    To put the state back into a model, use `load_state`.
