def CL_scaling_vector(x, g, lb, ub):
    """Compute Coleman-Li scaling vector and its derivatives.

    Components of a vector v are defined as follows::

               | ub[i] - x[i], if g[i] < 0 and ub[i] < np.inf
        v[i] = | x[i] - lb[i], if g[i] > 0 and lb[i] > -np.inf
               | 1,           otherwise

    According to this definition v[i] >= 0 for all i. It differs from the
    definition in paper [1]_ (eq. (2.2)), where the absolute value of v is
    used. Both definitions are equivalent down the line.
    Derivatives of v with respect to x take value 1, -1 or 0 depending on a
    case.

    Returns
    -------
    v : ndarray with shape of x
        Scaling vector.
    dv : ndarray with shape of x
        Derivatives of v[i] with respect to x[i], diagonal elements of v's
        Jacobian.
