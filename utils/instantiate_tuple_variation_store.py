):
    """Instantiate TupleVariation list at the given location, or limit axes' min/max.

    The 'variations' list of TupleVariation objects is modified in-place.
    The 'axisLimits' (dict) maps axis tags (str) to NormalizedAxisTriple namedtuples
    specifying (minimum, default, maximum) in the -1,0,+1 normalized space. Pinned axes
    have minimum == default == maximum.

    A 'full' instance (i.e. static font) is produced when all the axes are pinned to
    single coordinates; a 'partial' instance (i.e. a less variable font) is produced
    when some of the axes are omitted, or restricted with a new range.

    Tuples that do not participate are kept as they are. Those that have 0 influence
    at the given location are removed from the variation store.
    Those that are fully instantiated (i.e. all their axes are being pinned) are also
    removed from the variation store, their scaled deltas accummulated and returned, so
    that they can be added by the caller to the default instance's coordinates.
    Tuples that are only partially instantiated (i.e. not all the axes that they
    participate in are being pinned) are kept in the store, and their deltas multiplied
    by the scalar support of the axes to be pinned at the desired location.

    Args:
        variations: List[TupleVariation] from either 'gvar' or 'cvar'.
        axisLimits: NormalizedAxisLimits: map from axis tags to (min, default, max)
            normalized coordinates for the full or partial instance.
        origCoords: GlyphCoordinates: default instance's coordinates for computing 'gvar'
            inferred points (cf. table__g_l_y_f._getCoordinatesAndControls).
        endPts: List[int]: indices of contour end points, for inferring 'gvar' deltas.

    Returns:
        List[float]: the overall delta adjustment after applicable deltas were summed.
