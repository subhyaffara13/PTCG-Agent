    r"""Compare the survival distributions of two samples via the logrank test.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y : array_like or CensoredData
        Samples to compare based on their empirical survival functions.
    alternative : {'two-sided', 'less', 'greater'}, optional
        Defines the alternative hypothesis.

        The null hypothesis is that the survival distributions of the two
        groups, say *X* and *Y*, are identical.

        The following alternative hypotheses [4]_ are available (default is
        'two-sided'):

        * 'two-sided': the survival distributions of the two groups are not
          identical.
        * 'less': survival of group *X* is favored: the group *X* failure rate
          function is less than the group *Y* failure rate function at some
          times.
        * 'greater': survival of group *Y* is favored: the group *X* failure
          rate function is greater than the group *Y* failure rate function at
          some times.

    Returns
    -------
    res : `~scipy.stats._result_classes.LogRankResult`
        An object containing attributes:

        statistic : float ndarray
            The computed statistic (defined below). Its magnitude is the
            square root of the magnitude returned by most other logrank test
            implementations.
        pvalue : float ndarray
            The computed p-value of the test.

    Notes
    -----
    The logrank test [1]_ compares the observed number of events to
    the expected number of events under the null hypothesis that the two
    samples were drawn from the same distribution. The statistic is

    .. math::

        Z_i = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^J(O_{i,j}-E_{i,j})}{\sqrt{\sum_{j=1}^J V_{i,j}}}
        \rightarrow \mathcal{N}(0,1)

    where

    .. math::

        E_{i,j} = O_j \frac{N_{i,j}}{N_j},
        \qquad
        V_{i,j} = E_{i,j} \left(\frac{N_j-O_j}{N_j}\right)
        \left(\frac{N_j-N_{i,j}}{N_j-1}\right),

    :math:`i` denotes the group (i.e. it may assume values :math:`x` or
    :math:`y`, or it may be omitted to refer to the combined sample)
    :math:`j` denotes the time (at which an event occurred),
    :math:`N` is the number of subjects at risk just before an event occurred,
    and :math:`O` is the observed number of events at that time.

    The ``statistic`` :math:`Z_x` returned by `logrank` is the (signed) square
    root of the statistic returned by many other implementations. Under the
    null hypothesis, :math:`Z_x**2` is asymptotically distributed according to
    the chi-squared distribution with one degree of freedom. Consequently,
    :math:`Z_x` is asymptotically distributed according to the standard normal
    distribution. The advantage of using :math:`Z_x` is that the sign
    information (i.e. whether the observed number of events tends to be less
    than or greater than the number expected under the null hypothesis) is
    preserved, allowing `scipy.stats.logrank` to offer one-sided alternative
    hypotheses.

    Examples
    --------
    Reference [2]_ compared the survival times of patients with two different
    types of recurrent malignant gliomas. The samples below record the time
    (number of weeks) for which each patient participated in the study. The
    `scipy.stats.CensoredData` class is used because the data is
    right-censored: the uncensored observations correspond with observed deaths
    whereas the censored observations correspond with the patient leaving the
    study for another reason.

    >>> from scipy import stats
    >>> x = stats.CensoredData(
    ...     uncensored=[6, 13, 21, 30, 37, 38, 49, 50,
    ...                 63, 79, 86, 98, 202, 219],
    ...     right=[31, 47, 80, 82, 82, 149]
    ... )
    >>> y = stats.CensoredData(
    ...     uncensored=[10, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 24, 24,
    ...                 25, 28,30, 33, 35, 37, 40, 40, 46, 48, 76, 81,
    ...                 82, 91, 112, 181],
    ...     right=[34, 40, 70]
    ... )

    We can calculate and visualize the empirical survival functions
    of both groups as follows.

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> ax = plt.subplot()
    >>> ecdf_x = stats.ecdf(x)
    >>> ecdf_x.sf.plot(ax, label='Astrocytoma')
    >>> ecdf_y = stats.ecdf(y)
    >>> ecdf_y.sf.plot(ax, label='Glioblastoma')
    >>> ax.set_xlabel('Time to death (weeks)')
    >>> ax.set_ylabel('Empirical SF')
    >>> plt.legend()
    >>> plt.show()

    Visual inspection of the empirical survival functions suggests that the
    survival times tend to be different between the two groups. To formally
    assess whether the difference is significant at the 1% level, we use the
    logrank test.

    >>> res = stats.logrank(x=x, y=y)
    >>> res.statistic
    -2.73799
    >>> res.pvalue
    0.00618

    The p-value is less than 1%, so we can consider the data to be evidence
    against the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative that there is a
    difference between the two survival functions.
