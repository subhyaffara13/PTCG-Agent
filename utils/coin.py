def Coin(name, p=S.Half):
    r"""
    Create a Finite Random Variable representing a Coin toss.

    This is an equivalent of a Bernoulli random variable with
    "H" and "T" as success and failure events respectively.

    Parameters
    ==========

    p : Rational Number between 0 and 1
      Represents probability of getting "Heads", by default is Half

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.stats import Coin, density
    >>> from sympy import Rational

    >>> C = Coin('C') # A fair coin toss
    >>> density(C).dict
    {H: 1/2, T: 1/2}

    >>> C2 = Coin('C2', Rational(3, 5)) # An unfair coin
    >>> density(C2).dict
    {H: 3/5, T: 2/5}

    Returns
    =======

    RandomSymbol
