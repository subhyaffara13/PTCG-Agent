def kemeny_constant(G, *, weight=None):
    """Returns the Kemeny constant of the given graph.

    The *Kemeny constant* (or Kemeny's constant) of a graph `G`
    can be computed by regarding the graph as a Markov chain.
    The Kemeny constant is then the expected number of time steps
    to transition from a starting state i to a random destination state
    sampled from the Markov chain's stationary distribution.
    The Kemeny constant is independent of the chosen initial state [1]_.

    The Kemeny constant measures the time needed for spreading
    across a graph. Low values indicate a closely connected graph
    whereas high values indicate a spread-out graph.

    If weight is not provided, then a weight of 1 is used for all edges.

    Since `G` represents a Markov chain, the weights must be positive.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    weight : string or None, optional (default=None)
       The edge data key used to compute the Kemeny constant.
       If None, then each edge has weight 1.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        The Kemeny constant of the graph `G`.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXNotImplemented
        If the graph `G` is directed.

    NetworkXError
        If the graph `G` is not connected, or contains no nodes,
        or has edges with negative weights.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.complete_graph(5)
    >>> round(nx.kemeny_constant(G), 10)
    3.2

    Notes
    -----
    The implementation is based on equation (3.3) in [2]_.
    Self-loops are allowed and indicate a Markov chain where
    the state can remain the same. Multi-edges are contracted
    in one edge with weight equal to the sum of the weights.
