def _build_paths_from_predecessors(sources, target, pred):
    """Compute all simple paths to target, given the predecessors found in
    pred, terminating when any source in sources is found.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sources : set
       Starting nodes for path.

    target : node
       Ending node for path.

    pred : dict
       A dictionary of predecessor lists, keyed by node

    Returns
    -------
    paths : generator of lists
        A generator of all paths between source and target.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXNoPath
        If `target` cannot be reached from `source`.

    Notes
    -----
    There may be many paths between the sources and target.  If there are
    cycles among the predecessors, this function will not produce all
    possible paths because doing so would produce infinitely many paths
    of unbounded length -- instead, we only produce simple paths.
