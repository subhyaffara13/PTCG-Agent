def chebvander(x, deg):
    """Pseudo-Vandermonde matrix of given degree.

    Returns the pseudo-Vandermonde matrix of degree `deg` and sample points
    `x`. The pseudo-Vandermonde matrix is defined by

    .. math:: V[..., i] = T_i(x),

    where ``0 <= i <= deg``. The leading indices of `V` index the elements of
    `x` and the last index is the degree of the Chebyshev polynomial.

    If `c` is a 1-D array of coefficients of length ``n + 1`` and `V` is the
    matrix ``V = chebvander(x, n)``, then ``np.dot(V, c)`` and
    ``chebval(x, c)`` are the same up to roundoff.  This equivalence is
    useful both for least squares fitting and for the evaluation of a large
    number of Chebyshev series of the same degree and sample points.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        Array of points. The dtype is converted to float64 or complex128
        depending on whether any of the elements are complex. If `x` is
        scalar it is converted to a 1-D array.
    deg : int
        Degree of the resulting matrix.

    Returns
    -------
    vander : ndarray
        The pseudo Vandermonde matrix. The shape of the returned matrix is
        ``x.shape + (deg + 1,)``, where The last index is the degree of the
        corresponding Chebyshev polynomial.  The dtype will be the same as
        the converted `x`.
