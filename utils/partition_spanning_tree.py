def partition_spanning_tree(
    G, minimum=True, weight="weight", partition="partition", ignore_nan=False
):
    """
    Find a spanning tree while respecting a partition of edges.

    Edges can be flagged as either `INCLUDED` which are required to be in the
    returned tree, `EXCLUDED`, which cannot be in the returned tree and `OPEN`.

    This is used in the SpanningTreeIterator to create new partitions following
    the algorithm of Sörensen and Janssens [1]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : undirected graph
        An undirected graph.

    minimum : bool (default: True)
        Determines whether the returned tree is the minimum spanning tree of
        the partition of the maximum one.

    weight : str
        Data key to use for edge weights.

    partition : str
        The key for the edge attribute containing the partition
        data on the graph. Edges can be included, excluded or open using the
        `EdgePartition` enum.

    ignore_nan : bool (default: False)
        If a NaN is found as an edge weight normally an exception is raised.
        If `ignore_nan is True` then that edge is ignored instead.


    Returns
    -------
    G : NetworkX Graph
        A minimum spanning tree using all of the included edges in the graph and
        none of the excluded edges.
