    Debian's ``distutils.sysconfig.get_python_lib()`` implementation returns the
    default package path controlled by APT, but does not patch ``sysconfig`` to
    do the same. This is similar to the bug worked around in ``get_scheme()``,
    but here the default is ``deb_system`` instead of ``unix_local``. Ultimately
    we can't do anything about this Debian bug, and this detection allows us to
    skip the warning when needed.
