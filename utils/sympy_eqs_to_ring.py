def sympy_eqs_to_ring(eqs, symbols):
    """Convert a system of equations from Expr to a PolyRing

    Explanation
    ===========

    High-level functions like ``solve`` expect Expr as inputs but can use
    ``solve_lin_sys`` internally. This function converts equations from
    ``Expr`` to the low-level poly types used by the ``solve_lin_sys``
    function.

    Parameters
    ==========

    eqs: List of Expr
        A list of equations as Expr instances
    symbols: List of Symbol
        A list of the symbols that are the unknowns in the system of
        equations.

    Returns
    =======

    Tuple[List[PolyElement], Ring]: The equations as PolyElement instances
    and the ring of polynomials within which each equation is represented.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import symbols
    >>> from sympy.polys.solvers import sympy_eqs_to_ring
    >>> a, x, y = symbols('a, x, y')
    >>> eqs = [x-y, x+a*y]
    >>> eqs_ring, ring = sympy_eqs_to_ring(eqs, [x, y])
    >>> eqs_ring
    [x - y, x + a*y]
    >>> type(eqs_ring[0])
    <class 'sympy.polys.rings.PolyElement'>
    >>> ring
    ZZ(a)[x,y]

    With the equations in this form they can be passed to ``solve_lin_sys``:

    >>> from sympy.polys.solvers import solve_lin_sys
    >>> solve_lin_sys(eqs_ring, ring)
    {y: 0, x: 0}
