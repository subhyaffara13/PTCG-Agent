    Return the distro ID of the current distribution, as a
    machine-readable string.

    For a number of OS distributions, the returned distro ID value is
    *reliable*, in the sense that it is documented and that it does not change
    across releases of the distribution.

    This package maintains the following reliable distro ID values:

    If you have a need to get distros for reliable IDs added into this set,
    or if you find that the :func:`distro.id` function returns a different
    distro ID for one of the listed distros, please create an issue in the
    `distro issue tracker`_.

    **Lookup hierarchy and transformations:**

    First, the ID is obtained from the following sources, in the specified
    order. The first available and non-empty value is used:

    * the value of the "ID" attribute of the os-release file,

    * the value of the "Distributor ID" attribute returned by the lsb_release
      command,

    * the first part of the file name of the distro release file,

    The so determined ID value then passes the following transformations,
    before it is returned by this method:

    * it is translated to lower case,

    * blanks (which should not be there anyway) are translated to underscores,

    * a normalization of the ID is performed, based upon
      `normalization tables`_. The purpose of this normalization is to ensure
      that the ID is as reliable as possible, even across incompatible changes
      in the OS distributions. A common reason for an incompatible change is
      the addition of an os-release file, or the addition of the lsb_release
      command, with ID values that differ from what was previously determined
      from the distro release file name.
