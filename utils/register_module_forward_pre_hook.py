def register_module_forward_pre_hook(hook: Callable[..., None]) -> RemovableHandle:
    r"""Register a forward pre-hook common to all modules.

    .. warning ::

        This adds global state to the `nn.module` module
        and it is only intended for debugging/profiling purposes.

    The hook will be called every time before :func:`forward` is invoked.
    It should have the following signature::

        hook(module, input) -> None or modified input

    The input contains only the positional arguments given to the module.
    Keyword arguments won't be passed to the hooks and only to the ``forward``.
    The hook can modify the input. User can either return a tuple or a
    single modified value in the hook. We will wrap the value into a tuple
    if a single value is returned(unless that value is already a tuple).

    This hook has precedence over the specific module hooks registered with
    ``register_forward_pre_hook``.

    Returns:
        :class:`torch.utils.hooks.RemovableHandle`:
            a handle that can be used to remove the added hook by calling
            ``handle.remove()``
