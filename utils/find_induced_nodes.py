def find_induced_nodes(G, s, t, treewidth_bound=sys.maxsize):
    """Returns the set of induced nodes in the path from s to t.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
      A chordal NetworkX graph
    s : node
        Source node to look for induced nodes
    t : node
        Destination node to look for induced nodes
    treewidth_bound: float
        Maximum treewidth acceptable for the graph H. The search
        for induced nodes will end as soon as the treewidth_bound is exceeded.

    Returns
    -------
    induced_nodes : Set of nodes
        The set of induced nodes in the path from s to t in G

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        The algorithm does not support DiGraph, MultiGraph and MultiDiGraph.
        If the input graph is an instance of one of these classes, a
        :exc:`NetworkXError` is raised.
        The algorithm can only be applied to chordal graphs. If the input
        graph is found to be non-chordal, a :exc:`NetworkXError` is raised.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.Graph()
    >>> G = nx.generators.classic.path_graph(10)
    >>> induced_nodes = nx.find_induced_nodes(G, 1, 9, 2)
    >>> sorted(induced_nodes)
    [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

    Notes
    -----
    G must be a chordal graph and (s,t) an edge that is not in G.

    If a treewidth_bound is provided, the search for induced nodes will end
    as soon as the treewidth_bound is exceeded.

    The algorithm is inspired by Algorithm 4 in [1]_.
    A formal definition of induced node can also be found on that reference.

    Self Loops are ignored
