    """Returns an approximate solution to the traveling salesman problem.

    This function uses simulated annealing to approximate the minimal cost
    cycle through the nodes. Starting from a suboptimal solution, simulated
    annealing perturbs that solution, occasionally accepting changes that make
    the solution worse to escape from a locally optimal solution. The chance
    of accepting such changes decreases over the iterations to encourage
    an optimal result.  In summary, the function returns a cycle starting
    at `source` for which the total cost is minimized. It also returns the cost.

    The chance of accepting a proposed change is related to a parameter called
    the temperature (annealing has a physical analogue of steel hardening
    as it cools). As the temperature is reduced, the chance of moves that
    increase cost goes down.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : Graph
        `G` should be a complete weighted graph.
        The distance between all pairs of nodes should be included.

    init_cycle : list of all nodes or "greedy"
        The initial solution (a cycle through all nodes returning to the start).
        This argument has no default to make you think about it.
        If "greedy", use `greedy_tsp(G, weight)`.
        Other common starting cycles are `list(G) + [next(iter(G))]` or the final
        result of `simulated_annealing_tsp` when doing `threshold_accepting_tsp`.

    weight : string, optional (default="weight")
        Edge data key corresponding to the edge weight.
        If any edge does not have this attribute the weight is set to 1.

    source : node, optional (default: first node in list(G))
        Starting node.  If None, defaults to ``next(iter(G))``

    temp : int, optional (default=100)
        The algorithm's temperature parameter. It represents the initial
        value of temperature

    move : "1-1" or "1-0" or function, optional (default="1-1")
        Indicator of what move to use when finding new trial solutions.
        Strings indicate two special built-in moves:

        - "1-1": 1-1 exchange which transposes the position
          of two elements of the current solution.
          The function called is :func:`swap_two_nodes`.
          For example if we apply 1-1 exchange in the solution
          ``A = [3, 2, 1, 4, 3]``
          we can get the following by the transposition of 1 and 4 elements:
          ``A' = [3, 2, 4, 1, 3]``
        - "1-0": 1-0 exchange which moves an node in the solution
          to a new position.
          The function called is :func:`move_one_node`.
          For example if we apply 1-0 exchange in the solution
          ``A = [3, 2, 1, 4, 3]``
          we can transfer the fourth element to the second position:
          ``A' = [3, 4, 2, 1, 3]``

        You may provide your own functions to enact a move from
        one solution to a neighbor solution. The function must take
        the solution as input along with a `seed` input to control
        random number generation (see the `seed` input here).
        Your function should maintain the solution as a cycle with
        equal first and last node and all others appearing once.
        Your function should return the new solution.

    max_iterations : int, optional (default=10)
        Declared done when this number of consecutive iterations of
        the outer loop occurs without any change in the best cost solution.

    N_inner : int, optional (default=100)
        The number of iterations of the inner loop.

    alpha : float between (0, 1), optional (default=0.01)
        Percentage of temperature decrease in each iteration
        of outer loop

    seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
        Indicator of random number generation state.
        See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.

    Returns
    -------
    cycle : list of nodes
        Returns the cycle (list of nodes) that a salesman
        can follow to minimize total weight of the trip.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        If `G` is not complete the algorithm raises an exception.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from networkx.algorithms import approximation as approx
    >>> G = nx.DiGraph()
    >>> G.add_weighted_edges_from(
    ...     {
    ...         ("A", "B", 3),

    ...         ("A", "D", 14),
    ...         ("B", "A", 3),
    ...         ("B", "C", 12),
    ...         ("B", "D", 16),

    ...         ("D", "B", 15),
    ...         ("D", "C", 2),
    ...     }
    ... )
    >>> cycle = approx.simulated_annealing_tsp(G, "greedy", source="D")
    >>> cost = sum(G[n][nbr]["weight"] for n, nbr in nx.utils.pairwise(cycle))
    >>> cycle
    ['D', 'C', 'B', 'A', 'D']
    >>> cost
    31
    >>> incycle = ["D", "B", "A", "C", "D"]
    >>> cycle = approx.simulated_annealing_tsp(G, incycle, source="D")
    >>> cost = sum(G[n][nbr]["weight"] for n, nbr in nx.utils.pairwise(cycle))
    >>> cycle
    ['D', 'C', 'B', 'A', 'D']
    >>> cost
    31

    Notes
    -----
    Simulated Annealing is a metaheuristic local search algorithm.
    The main characteristic of this algorithm is that it accepts
    even solutions which lead to the increase of the cost in order
    to escape from low quality local optimal solutions.

    This algorithm needs an initial solution. If not provided, it is
    constructed by a simple greedy algorithm. At every iteration, the
    algorithm selects thoughtfully a neighbor solution.
    Consider $c(x)$ cost of current solution and $c(x')$ cost of a
    neighbor solution.
    If $c(x') - c(x) <= 0$ then the neighbor solution becomes the current
    solution for the next iteration. Otherwise, the algorithm accepts
    the neighbor solution with probability $p = exp - ([c(x') - c(x)] / temp)$.
    Otherwise the current solution is retained.

    `temp` is a parameter of the algorithm and represents temperature.

    Time complexity:
    For $N_i$ iterations of the inner loop and $N_o$ iterations of the
    outer loop, this algorithm has running time $O(N_i * N_o * |V|)$.

    For more information and how the algorithm is inspired see:
