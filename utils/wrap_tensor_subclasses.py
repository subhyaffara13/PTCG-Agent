    # Note: [Partitioner handling for Subclasses, Part 2]
    # At the beginning of AOTAutograd, we collect metadata on the inputs and outputs of the user fw,
    # to figure out which inputs/outputs are subclasses, and how to reconstruct the subclasses after flattening them.
    #
    # When this function is called at runtime in the forward,
    # we have been passed a list of (flattened) dense-tensor fw-outs, and need to reconstruct any subclass fw outs.
    #
    # One reasonable question that you should ask: when should the dense_tensor -> subclass_tensor wrapping happen?
    # Answer: we do it **inside of our compiled autograd.Function**.
    # This seems like morally the right place: autograd happens above subclass desugaring,
    # so autograd should see actual tensor subclasses at runtime, and not flattened dense tensors.
    #
    # This causes a tricky interaction though: when we run the min-cut partitioner to divvy up the joint graph
    # into a forward and backward graph, we end up with some activations that show up as extra outputs
    # in the compiled forward graph, that are **not** user outputs.
    # These activations are not visible to the user, and so there's no need for us to wrap them back into subclasses.
    #
    # On top of that, when we first computed subclass metadata (in `run_functionalized_fw_and_collect_metadata`),
    # we computed subclass metadata on every forward output, but this did **not** include activations
    # created by the partitioner.
    # as a result, `unwrapped_args` here will correspond to (*unwrapped_user_fw_outs, *activations),
    # but `subclass_metas` will only correspond to subclass metadata on `user_fw_outs`.
    # We then need to make sure that we return (*wrapped_user_fw_outs, *activations).
