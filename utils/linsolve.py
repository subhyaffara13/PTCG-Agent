def linsolve(system, *symbols):
    r"""
    Solve system of $N$ linear equations with $M$ variables; both
    underdetermined and overdetermined systems are supported.
    The possible number of solutions is zero, one or infinite.
    Zero solutions throws a ValueError, whereas infinite
    solutions are represented parametrically in terms of the given
    symbols. For unique solution a :class:`~.FiniteSet` of ordered tuples
    is returned.

    All standard input formats are supported:
    For the given set of equations, the respective input types
    are given below:

    .. math:: 3x + 2y -   z = 1
    .. math:: 2x - 2y + 4z = -2
    .. math:: 2x -   y + 2z = 0

    * Augmented matrix form, ``system`` given below:

    $$ \text{system} = \left[{array}{cccc}
        3 &  2 & -1 &  1\\
        2 & -2 &  4 & -2\\
        2 & -1 &  2 &  0
        \end{array}\right] $$

    ::

        system = Matrix([[3, 2, -1, 1], [2, -2, 4, -2], [2, -1, 2, 0]])

    * List of equations form

    ::

        system  =  [3x + 2y - z - 1, 2x - 2y + 4z + 2, 2x - y + 2z]

    * Input $A$ and $b$ in matrix form (from $Ax = b$) are given as:

    $$ A = \left[\begin{array}{ccc}
        3 &  2 & -1 \\
        2 & -2 &  4 \\
        2 & -1 &  2
        \end{array}\right] \ \  b = \left[\begin{array}{c}
        1 \\ -2 \\ 0
        \end{array}\right] $$

    ::

        A = Matrix([[3, 2, -1], [2, -2, 4], [2, -1, 2]])
        b = Matrix([[1], [-2], [0]])
        system = (A, b)

    Symbols can always be passed but are actually only needed
    when 1) a system of equations is being passed and 2) the
    system is passed as an underdetermined matrix and one wants
    to control the name of the free variables in the result.
    An error is raised if no symbols are used for case 1, but if
    no symbols are provided for case 2, internally generated symbols
    will be provided. When providing symbols for case 2, there should
    be at least as many symbols are there are columns in matrix A.

    The algorithm used here is Gauss-Jordan elimination, which
    results, after elimination, in a row echelon form matrix.

    Returns
    =======

    A FiniteSet containing an ordered tuple of values for the
    unknowns for which the `system` has a solution. (Wrapping
    the tuple in FiniteSet is used to maintain a consistent
    output format throughout solveset.)

    Returns EmptySet, if the linear system is inconsistent.

    Raises
    ======

    ValueError
        The input is not valid.
        The symbols are not given.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import Matrix, linsolve, symbols
    >>> x, y, z = symbols("x, y, z")
    >>> A = Matrix([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 10]])
    >>> b = Matrix([3, 6, 9])
    >>> A
    Matrix([
    [1, 2,  3],
    [4, 5,  6],
    [7, 8, 10]])
    >>> b
    Matrix([
    [3],
    [6],
    [9]])
    >>> linsolve((A, b), [x, y, z])
    {(-1, 2, 0)}

    * Parametric Solution: In case the system is underdetermined, the
      function will return a parametric solution in terms of the given
      symbols. Those that are free will be returned unchanged. e.g. in
      the system below, `z` is returned as the solution for variable z;
      it can take on any value.

    >>> A = Matrix([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])
    >>> b = Matrix([3, 6, 9])
    >>> linsolve((A, b), x, y, z)
    {(z - 1, 2 - 2*z, z)}

    If no symbols are given, internally generated symbols will be used.
    The ``tau0`` in the third position indicates (as before) that the third
    variable -- whatever it is named -- can take on any value:

    >>> linsolve((A, b))
    {(tau0 - 1, 2 - 2*tau0, tau0)}

    * List of equations as input

    >>> Eqns = [3*x + 2*y - z - 1, 2*x - 2*y + 4*z + 2, - x + y/2 - z]
    >>> linsolve(Eqns, x, y, z)
    {(1, -2, -2)}

    * Augmented matrix as input

    >>> aug = Matrix([[2, 1, 3, 1], [2, 6, 8, 3], [6, 8, 18, 5]])
    >>> aug
    Matrix([
    [2, 1,  3, 1],
    [2, 6,  8, 3],
    [6, 8, 18, 5]])
    >>> linsolve(aug, x, y, z)
    {(3/10, 2/5, 0)}

    * Solve for symbolic coefficients

    >>> a, b, c, d, e, f = symbols('a, b, c, d, e, f')
    >>> eqns = [a*x + b*y - c, d*x + e*y - f]
    >>> linsolve(eqns, x, y)
    {((-b*f + c*e)/(a*e - b*d), (a*f - c*d)/(a*e - b*d))}

    * A degenerate system returns solution as set of given
      symbols.

    >>> system = Matrix(([0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]))
    >>> linsolve(system, x, y)
    {(x, y)}

    * For an empty system linsolve returns empty set

    >>> linsolve([], x)
    EmptySet

    * An error is raised if any nonlinearity is detected, even
      if it could be removed with expansion

    >>> linsolve([x*(1/x - 1)], x)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    NonlinearError: nonlinear term: 1/x

    >>> linsolve([x*(y + 1)], x, y)
    Traceback (most recent call last):

    >>> linsolve([x**2 - 1], x)
