def _replace_unbacked_bindings(gm: torch.fx.GraphModule) -> None:
    """
    When we run an interpreter-based pass over a GraphModule, execution of data-dependent operators
    will produce example values with new unbacked symbols. To track that the new/old symbols are equivalent,
    we used to rely on the unbacked_renamings mapping. This led to problematic metadata where the unbacked_bindings
    keys mapped new symbols (u2) to paths containing old symbols (u0) in the example values, or worse, backed symbols
    or constants (e.g. if the original unbacked was replaced/specialized). Additionally this created problems with
    de/serialized programs, since we didn't comprehensively serialize ShapeEnv/unbacked renamings/node bindings.

    This pass attempts a simpler way of handling these for export, by throwing away the previously computed bindings, and re-running
    the pattern match used in compute_unbacked_bindings. This ensures we keep the original symbols contained in the example values,
    or delete bindings if they've been replaced/specialized.
