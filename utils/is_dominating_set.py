    """Checks if `nbunch` is a dominating set for `G`.

    A *dominating set* for a graph with node set *V* is a subset *D* of
    *V* such that every node not in *D* is adjacent to at least one
    member of *D* [1]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    nbunch : iterable
        An iterable of nodes in the graph `G`.

    Returns
    -------
    dominating : bool
        True if `nbunch` is a dominating set of `G`, false otherwise.
