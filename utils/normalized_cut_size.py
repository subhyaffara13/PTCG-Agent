def normalized_cut_size(G, S, T=None, weight=None):
    """Returns the normalized size of the cut between two sets of nodes.

    The *normalized cut size* is the cut size times the sum of the
    reciprocal sizes of the volumes of the two sets. [1]

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    S : collection
        A collection of nodes in `G`.

    T : collection
        A collection of nodes in `G`.

    weight : object
        Edge attribute key to use as weight. If not specified, edges
        have weight one.

    Returns
    -------
    number
        The normalized cut size between the two sets `S` and `T`.

    Notes
    -----
    In a multigraph, the cut size is the total weight of edges including
    multiplicity.
