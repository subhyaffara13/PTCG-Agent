def petersen_graph(create_using=None):
    """
    Returns the Petersen Graph.

    The Peterson Graph is a cubic, undirected graph with 10 nodes and 15 edges [1]_.
    Julius Petersen constructed the graph as the smallest counterexample
    against the claim that a connected bridgeless cubic graph
    has an edge colouring with three colours [2]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    create_using : NetworkX graph constructor, optional (default=nx.Graph)
       Graph type to create. If graph instance, then cleared before populated.

    Returns
    -------
    G : networkx Graph
        Petersen Graph
