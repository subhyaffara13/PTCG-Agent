    For more information, please check the spec: `<https://toml.io/en/v1.0.0#string>`__.

    Common escaping rules will be applied for basic strings.
    This can be controlled by explicitly setting ``escape=False``.
    Please note that, if you disable escaping, you will have to make sure that
    the given strings don't contain any forbidden character or sequence.
