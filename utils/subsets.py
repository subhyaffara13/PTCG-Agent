def subsets(seq, k=None, repetition=False):
    r"""Generates all `k`-subsets (combinations) from an `n`-element set, ``seq``.

    A `k`-subset of an `n`-element set is any subset of length exactly `k`. The
    number of `k`-subsets of an `n`-element set is given by ``binomial(n, k)``,
    whereas there are `2^n` subsets all together. If `k` is ``None`` then all
    `2^n` subsets will be returned from shortest to longest.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import subsets

    ``subsets(seq, k)`` will return the
    `\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}` `k`-subsets (combinations)
    without repetition, i.e. once an item has been removed, it can no
    longer be "taken":

        >>> list(subsets([1, 2], 2))
        [(1, 2)]
        >>> list(subsets([1, 2]))
        [(), (1,), (2,), (1, 2)]
        >>> list(subsets([1, 2, 3], 2))
        [(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)]


    ``subsets(seq, k, repetition=True)`` will return the
    `\frac{(n - 1 + k)!}{k!(n - 1)!}`
    combinations *with* repetition:

        >>> list(subsets([1, 2], 2, repetition=True))
        [(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2)]

    If you ask for more items than are in the set you get the empty set unless
    you allow repetitions:

        >>> list(subsets([0, 1], 3, repetition=False))
        []
        >>> list(subsets([0, 1], 3, repetition=True))
        [(0, 0, 0), (0, 0, 1), (0, 1, 1), (1, 1, 1)]
