def antichains(G, topo_order=None):
    """Generates antichains from a directed acyclic graph (DAG).

    An antichain is a subset of a partially ordered set such that any
    two elements in the subset are incomparable.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX DiGraph
        A directed acyclic graph (DAG)

    topo_order: list or tuple, optional
        A topological order for G (if None, the function will compute one)

    Yields
    ------
    antichain : list
        a list of nodes in `G` representing an antichain

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXNotImplemented
        If `G` is not directed

    NetworkXUnfeasible
        If `G` contains a cycle

    Examples
    --------
    >>> DG = nx.DiGraph([(1, 2), (1, 3)])
    >>> list(nx.antichains(DG))
    [[], [3], [2], [2, 3], [1]]
