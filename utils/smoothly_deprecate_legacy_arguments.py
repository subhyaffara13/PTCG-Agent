def smoothly_deprecate_legacy_arguments(fn_name: str, kwargs: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]:
    """Smoothly deprecate legacy arguments in the `huggingface_hub` codebase.

    This function ignores some deprecated arguments from the kwargs and warns the user they are ignored.
    The goal is to avoid breaking existing code while guiding the user to the new way of doing things.

    List of deprecated arguments:
        - `proxies`:
            To set up proxies, user must either use the HTTP_PROXY environment variable or configure the `httpx.Client`
            manually using the [`set_client_factory`] function.

            In huggingface_hub 0.x, `proxies` was a dictionary directly passed to `requests.request`.
            In huggingface_hub 1.x, we migrated to `httpx` which does not support `proxies` the same way.
            In particular, it is not possible to configure proxies on a per-request basis. The solution is to configure
            it globally using the [`set_client_factory`] function or using the HTTP_PROXY environment variable.

            For more details, see:
            - https://www.python-httpx.org/advanced/proxies/
            - https://www.python-httpx.org/compatibility/#proxy-keys.

        - `resume_download`: deprecated without replacement. `huggingface_hub` always resumes downloads whenever possible.
        - `force_filename`: deprecated without replacement. Filename is always the same as on the Hub.
        - `local_dir_use_symlinks`: deprecated without replacement. Downloading to a local directory does not use symlinks anymore.
