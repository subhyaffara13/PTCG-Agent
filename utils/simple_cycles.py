    """Find simple cycles (elementary circuits) of a graph.

    A "simple cycle", or "elementary circuit", is a closed path where
    no node appears twice.  In a directed graph, two simple cycles are distinct
    if they are not cyclic permutations of each other.  In an undirected graph,
    two simple cycles are distinct if they are not cyclic permutations of each
    other nor of the other's reversal.

    Optionally, the cycles are bounded in length.  In the unbounded case, we use
    a nonrecursive, iterator/generator version of Johnson's algorithm [1]_.  In
    the bounded case, we use a version of the algorithm of Gupta and
    Suzumura [2]_. There may be better algorithms for some cases [3]_ [4]_ [5]_.

    The algorithms of Johnson, and Gupta and Suzumura, are enhanced by some
    well-known preprocessing techniques.  When `G` is directed, we restrict our
    attention to strongly connected components of `G`, generate all simple cycles
    containing a certain node, remove that node, and further decompose the
    remainder into strongly connected components.  When `G` is undirected, we
    restrict our attention to biconnected components, generate all simple cycles
    containing a particular edge, remove that edge, and further decompose the
    remainder into biconnected components.

    Note that multigraphs are supported by this function -- and in undirected
    multigraphs, a pair of parallel edges is considered a cycle of length 2.
    Likewise, self-loops are considered to be cycles of length 1.  We define
    cycles as sequences of nodes; so the presence of loops and parallel edges
    does not change the number of simple cycles in a graph.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX Graph
       A networkx graph. Undirected, directed, and multigraphs are all supported.

    length_bound : int or None, optional (default=None)
       If `length_bound` is an int, generate all simple cycles of `G` with length at
       most `length_bound`.  Otherwise, generate all simple cycles of `G`.

    Yields
    ------
    list of nodes
       Each cycle is represented by a list of nodes along the cycle.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.DiGraph([(0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2)])
    >>> sorted(nx.simple_cycles(G))
    [[0], [0, 1, 2], [0, 2], [1, 2], [2]]

    To filter the cycles so that they don't include certain nodes or edges,
    copy your graph and eliminate those nodes or edges before calling.
    For example, to exclude self-loops from the above example:

    >>> H = G.copy()
    >>> H.remove_edges_from(nx.selfloop_edges(G))
    >>> sorted(nx.simple_cycles(H))
    [[0, 1, 2], [0, 2], [1, 2]]

    Notes
    -----
    When `length_bound` is None, the time complexity is $O((n+e)(c+1))$ for $n$
    nodes, $e$ edges and $c$ simple circuits.  Otherwise, when ``length_bound > 1``,
    the time complexity is $O((c+n)(k-1)d^k)$ where $d$ is the average degree of
    the nodes of `G` and $k$ = `length_bound`.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        when ``length_bound < 0``.
