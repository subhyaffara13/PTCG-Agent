    """Returns the volume of a set of nodes.

    The *volume* of a set *S* is the sum of the (out-)degrees of nodes
    in *S* (taking into account parallel edges in multigraphs). [1]

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    S : collection
        A collection of nodes in `G`.

    weight : object
        Edge attribute key to use as weight. If not specified, edges
        have weight one.

    Returns
    -------
    number
        The volume of the set of nodes represented by `S` in the graph
        `G`.
