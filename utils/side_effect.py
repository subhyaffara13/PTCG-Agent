    """Invoke *func* on each item in *iterable* (or on each *chunk_size* group
    of items) before yielding the item.

    `func` must be a function that takes a single argument. Its return value
    will be discarded.

    *before* and *after* are optional functions that take no arguments. They
    will be executed before iteration starts and after it ends, respectively.

    `side_effect` can be used for logging, updating progress bars, or anything
    that is not functionally "pure."

    Emitting a status message:

        >>> from more_itertools import consume
        >>> func = lambda item: print('Received {}'.format(item))
        >>> consume(side_effect(func, range(2)))
        Received 0
        Received 1

    Operating on chunks of items:

        >>> pair_sums = []
        >>> func = lambda chunk: pair_sums.append(sum(chunk))
        >>> list(side_effect(func, [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 2))
        [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        >>> list(pair_sums)
        [1, 5, 9]

    Writing to a file-like object:

        >>> from io import StringIO
        >>> from more_itertools import consume
        >>> f = StringIO()
        >>> func = lambda x: print(x, file=f)
        >>> before = lambda: print(u'HEADER', file=f)
        >>> after = f.close
        >>> it = [u'a', u'b', u'c']
        >>> consume(side_effect(func, it, before=before, after=after))
        >>> f.closed
        True
