    """Generate a Gaussian random partition graph.

    A Gaussian random partition graph is created by creating k partitions
    each with a size drawn from a normal distribution with mean s and variance
    s/v. Nodes are connected within clusters with probability p_in and
    between clusters with probability p_out[1]

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : int
      Number of nodes in the graph
    s : float
      Mean cluster size
    v : float
      Shape parameter. The variance of cluster size distribution is s/v.
    p_in : float
      Probability of intra cluster connection.
    p_out : float
      Probability of inter cluster connection.
    directed : boolean, optional default=False
      Whether to create a directed graph or not
    seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
        Indicator of random number generation state.
        See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.

    Returns
    -------
    G : NetworkX Graph or DiGraph
      gaussian random partition graph

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
      If s is > n
      If p_in or p_out is not in [0,1]

    Notes
    -----
    Note the number of partitions is dependent on s,v and n, and that the
    last partition may be considerably smaller, as it is sized to simply
    fill out the nodes [1]

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.gaussian_random_partition_graph(100, 10, 10, 0.25, 0.1)
    >>> len(G)
    100
