    UNSHARD refers to fetching the full contents of an FSDP-sharded layer, requiring an all-gather operation.
    RESHARD does the opposite, releasing memory (but doing no communication)

    We abandon the "timestep lock"  during lowering

    max_active_stages controls how many prefetches we allow. It should be measured in mb and tuneable but in practice
    3 stages is probably the thing we want?
