def remez(numtaps, bands, desired, *, weight=None, type='bandpass',
          maxiter=25, grid_density=16, fs=None):
    """
    Calculate the minimax optimal filter using the Remez exchange algorithm.

    Calculate the filter-coefficients for the finite impulse response
    (FIR) filter whose transfer function minimizes the maximum error
    between the desired gain and the realized gain in the specified
    frequency bands using the Remez exchange algorithm.

    Parameters
    ----------
    numtaps : int
        The desired number of taps in the filter. The number of taps is
        the number of terms in the filter, or the filter order plus one.
    bands : array_like
        A monotonic sequence containing the band edges.
        All elements must be non-negative and less than half the sampling
        frequency as given by `fs`.
    desired : array_like
        A sequence half the size of bands containing the desired gain
        in each of the specified bands.
    weight : array_like, optional
        A relative weighting to give to each band region. The length of
        `weight` has to be half the length of `bands`.
    type : {'bandpass', 'differentiator', 'hilbert'}, optional
        The type of filter:

        * 'bandpass' : flat response in bands. This is the default.
        * 'differentiator' : frequency proportional response in bands.
        * 'hilbert' : filter with odd symmetry, that is, type III
          (for even order) or type IV (for odd order) linear phase filters.

    maxiter : int, optional
        Maximum number of iterations of the algorithm. Default is 25.
    grid_density : int, optional
        Grid density. The dense grid used in `remez` is of size
        ``(numtaps + 1) * grid_density``. Default is 16.
    fs : float, optional
        The sampling frequency of the signal.  Default is 1.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        A rank-1 array containing the coefficients of the optimal
        (in a minimax sense) filter.

    Examples
    --------
    In these examples, `remez` is used to design low-pass, high-pass,
    band-pass and band-stop filters.  The parameters that define each filter
    are the filter order, the band boundaries, the transition widths of the
    boundaries, the desired gains in each band, and the sampling frequency.

    We'll use a sample frequency of 22050 Hz in all the examples.  In each
    example, the desired gain in each band is either 0 (for a stop band)
    or 1 (for a pass band).

    `freqz` is used to compute the frequency response of each filter, and
    the utility function ``plot_response`` defined below is used to plot
    the response.

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from scipy import signal
    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    >>> fs = 22050   # Sample rate, Hz

    >>> def plot_response(w, h, title):
    ...     "Utility function to plot response functions"
    ...     fig = plt.figure()
    ...     ax = fig.add_subplot(111)
    ...     ax.plot(w, 20*np.log10(np.abs(h)))
    ...     ax.set_ylim(-40, 5)
    ...     ax.grid(True)
    ...     ax.set_xlabel('Frequency (Hz)')
    ...     ax.set_ylabel('Gain (dB)')
    ...     ax.set_title(title)

    The first example is a low-pass filter, with cutoff frequency 8 kHz.
    The filter length is 325, and the transition width from pass to stop
    is 100 Hz.

    >>> cutoff = 8000.0    # Desired cutoff frequency, Hz
    >>> trans_width = 100  # Width of transition from pass to stop, Hz
    >>> numtaps = 325      # Size of the FIR filter.
    >>> taps = signal.remez(numtaps, [0, cutoff, cutoff + trans_width, 0.5*fs],
    ...                     [1, 0], fs=fs)
    >>> w, h = signal.freqz(taps, [1], worN=2000, fs=fs)
    >>> plot_response(w, h, "Low-pass Filter")
    >>> plt.show()

    This example shows a high-pass filter:

    >>> cutoff = 2000.0    # Desired cutoff frequency, Hz
    >>> trans_width = 250  # Width of transition from pass to stop, Hz
    >>> numtaps = 125      # Size of the FIR filter.
    >>> taps = signal.remez(numtaps, [0, cutoff - trans_width, cutoff, 0.5*fs],
    ...                     [0, 1], fs=fs)
    >>> w, h = signal.freqz(taps, [1], worN=2000, fs=fs)
    >>> plot_response(w, h, "High-pass Filter")
    >>> plt.show()

    This example shows a band-pass filter with a pass-band from 2 kHz to
    5 kHz.  The transition width is 260 Hz and the length of the filter
    is 63, which is smaller than in the other examples:

    >>> band = [2000, 5000]  # Desired pass band, Hz
    >>> trans_width = 260    # Width of transition from pass to stop, Hz
    >>> numtaps = 63         # Size of the FIR filter.
    >>> edges = [0, band[0] - trans_width, band[0], band[1],
    ...          band[1] + trans_width, 0.5*fs]
    >>> taps = signal.remez(numtaps, edges, [0, 1, 0], fs=fs)
    >>> w, h = signal.freqz(taps, [1], worN=2000, fs=fs)
    >>> plot_response(w, h, "Band-pass Filter")
    >>> plt.show()

    The low order leads to higher ripple and less steep transitions.

    The next example shows a band-stop filter.

    >>> band = [6000, 8000]  # Desired stop band, Hz
    >>> trans_width = 200    # Width of transition from pass to stop, Hz
    >>> numtaps = 175        # Size of the FIR filter.
    >>> edges = [0, band[0] - trans_width, band[0], band[1],
    ...          band[1] + trans_width, 0.5*fs]
    >>> taps = signal.remez(numtaps, edges, [1, 0, 1], fs=fs)
    >>> w, h = signal.freqz(taps, [1], worN=2000, fs=fs)
    >>> plot_response(w, h, "Band-stop Filter")
    >>> plt.show()
