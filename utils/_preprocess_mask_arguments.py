    """
    Perform some common pre-processing of the mask arguments we get from the modeling code. Mostly determine the
    key-value length and offsets, and if we should early exit or not.

    Args:
        config (`PreTrainedConfig`):
            The model config.
        inputs_embeds (`torch.Tensor`):
            The input embeddings of shape (batch_size, query_length, hidden_dim). This is used only to infer the
            batch size, query length and dtype.
        attention_mask (`torch.Tensor`, optional):
            The 2D attention mask corresponding to padded tokens of shape (batch_size, number_of_seen_tokens+q_length).
            It can also be an already prepared 4D mask, in which case it is returned as-is.
        past_key_values (`Cache`, optional):
            The past key values, if we use a cache.
        position_ids (`torch.Tensor`, optional)
            A 2D tensor of shape (batch_size, query_length) indicating the positions of each token in the sequences.
        layer_idx (`int`, optional):
            If `past_key_values` is not None, this is the layer index of the cache from which to get the key-value
            length and offset. Indeed, for hybrid caches, different layers may return different lengths.
        encoder_hidden_states (`torch.Tensor`, optional):
            The input embeddings of shape (batch_size, kv_length, hidden_dim). If provided, it is used instead of
            `inputs_embeds` to infer the kv length.

    Returns:
        early_exit (`bool`):
            Whether we should early exit mask creation, and return the mask as-is.
        attention_mask (`torch.Tensor` or `BlockMask` or `None`):
            The attention mask to either return immediately, or to use in downstream mask creation.
        packed_sequence_mask (`torch.Tensor`, optional):
            In case we detected packed sequence format, this is a tensor where each similar integer indicates that
            the tokens belong to the same sequence.
        q_length (`int`):
            The size that the query states will have during the attention computation.
        kv_length (`int`):
            The size that the key and value states will have during the attention computation.
        q_offset (`int`, optional):
            An optional offset to indicate at which first position the query states will refer to.
        kv_offset (`int`):
            An offset to indicate at which first position the key and values states will refer to.
