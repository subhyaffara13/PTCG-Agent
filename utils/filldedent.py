    """
    Strips leading and trailing empty lines from a copy of ``s``, then dedents,
    fills and returns it.

    Empty line stripping serves to deal with docstrings like this one that
    start with a newline after the initial triple quote, inserting an empty
    line at the beginning of the string.

    Additional keyword arguments will be passed to ``textwrap.fill()``.
