def biconnected_component_edges(G):
    """Returns a generator of lists of edges, one list for each biconnected
    component of the input graph.

    Biconnected components are maximal subgraphs such that the removal of a
    node (and all edges incident on that node) will not disconnect the
    subgraph.  Note that nodes may be part of more than one biconnected
    component.  Those nodes are articulation points, or cut vertices.
    However, each edge belongs to one, and only one, biconnected component.

    Notice that by convention a dyad is considered a biconnected component.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX Graph
        An undirected graph.

    Returns
    -------
    edges : generator of lists
        Generator of lists of edges, one list for each bicomponent.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXNotImplemented
        If the input graph is not undirected.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.barbell_graph(4, 2)
    >>> print(nx.is_biconnected(G))
    False
    >>> bicomponents_edges = list(nx.biconnected_component_edges(G))
    >>> len(bicomponents_edges)
    5
    >>> G.add_edge(2, 8)
    >>> print(nx.is_biconnected(G))
    True
    >>> bicomponents_edges = list(nx.biconnected_component_edges(G))
    >>> len(bicomponents_edges)
    1

    Notes
    -----
    The algorithm to find articulation points and biconnected
    components is implemented using a non-recursive depth-first-search
    (DFS) that keeps track of the highest level that back edges reach
    in the DFS tree.  A node `n` is an articulation point if, and only
    if, there exists a subtree rooted at `n` such that there is no
    back edge from any successor of `n` that links to a predecessor of
    `n` in the DFS tree.  By keeping track of all the edges traversed
    by the DFS we can obtain the biconnected components because all
    edges of a bicomponent will be traversed consecutively between
    articulation points.
