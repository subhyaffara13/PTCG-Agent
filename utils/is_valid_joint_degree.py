def is_valid_joint_degree(joint_degrees):
    """Checks whether the given joint degree dictionary is realizable.

    A *joint degree dictionary* is a dictionary of dictionaries, in
    which entry ``joint_degrees[k][l]`` is an integer representing the
    number of edges joining nodes of degree *k* with nodes of degree
    *l*. Such a dictionary is realizable as a simple graph if and only
    if the following conditions are satisfied.

    - each entry must be an integer,
    - the total number of nodes of degree *k*, computed by
      ``sum(joint_degrees[k].values()) / k``, must be an integer,
    - the total number of edges joining nodes of degree *k* with
      nodes of degree *l* cannot exceed the total number of possible edges,
    - each diagonal entry ``joint_degrees[k][k]`` must be even (this is
      a convention assumed by the :func:`joint_degree_graph` function).


    Parameters
    ----------
    joint_degrees :  dictionary of dictionary of integers
        A joint degree dictionary in which entry ``joint_degrees[k][l]``
        is the number of edges joining nodes of degree *k* with nodes of
        degree *l*.

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        Whether the given joint degree dictionary is realizable as a
        simple graph.
