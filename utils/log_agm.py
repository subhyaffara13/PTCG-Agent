def log_agm(x, prec):
    """
    Fixed-point computation of -log(x) = log(1/x), suitable
    for large precision. It is required that 0 < x < 1. The
    algorithm used is the Sasaki-Kanada formula

        -log(x) = pi/agm(theta2(x)^2,theta3(x)^2). [1]

    For faster convergence in the theta functions, x should
    be chosen closer to 0.

    Guard bits must be added by the caller.

    HYPOTHESIS: if x = 2^(-n), n bits need to be added to
    account for the truncation to a fixed-point number,
    and this is the only significant cancellation error.

    The number of bits lost to roundoff is small and can be
    considered constant.
