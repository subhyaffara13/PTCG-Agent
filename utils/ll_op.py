def ll_op(left, right):
    """Perform a LL operation.

    A LL operation multiplies both left and right circuits
    with the dagger of the left circuit's leftmost gate, and
    the dagger is multiplied on the left side of both circuits.

    If a LL is possible, it returns the new gate rule as a
    2-tuple (LHS, RHS), where LHS is the left circuit and
    and RHS is the right circuit of the new rule.
    If a LL is not possible, None is returned.

    Parameters
    ==========

    left : Gate tuple
        The left circuit of a gate rule expression.
    right : Gate tuple
        The right circuit of a gate rule expression.

    Examples
    ========

    Generate a new gate rule using a LL operation:

    >>> from sympy.physics.quantum.identitysearch import ll_op
    >>> from sympy.physics.quantum.gate import X, Y, Z
    >>> x = X(0); y = Y(0); z = Z(0)
    >>> ll_op((x, y, z), ())
    ((Y(0), Z(0)), (X(0),))

    >>> ll_op((y, z), (x,))
    ((Z(0),), (Y(0), X(0)))
    """

    if (len(left) > 0):
        ll_gate = left[0]
        ll_gate_is_unitary = is_scalar_matrix(
            (Dagger(ll_gate), ll_gate), _get_min_qubits(ll_gate), True)

    if (len(left) > 0 and ll_gate_is_unitary):
        # Get the new left side w/o the leftmost gate
        new_left = left[1:len(left)]
        # Add the leftmost gate to the left position on the right side
        new_right = (Dagger(ll_gate),) + right
        # Return the new gate rule
        return (new_left, new_right)
