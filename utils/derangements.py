def derangements(iterable, r=None):
    """Yield successive derangements of the elements in *iterable*.

    A derangement is a permutation in which no element appears at its original
    index. In other words, a derangement is a permutation that has no fixed points.

    Suppose Alice, Bob, Carol, and Dave are playing Secret Santa.
    The code below outputs all of the different ways to assign gift recipients
    such that nobody is assigned to himself or herself:

        >>> for d in derangements(['Alice', 'Bob', 'Carol', 'Dave']):
        ...    print(', '.join(d))
        Bob, Alice, Dave, Carol
        Bob, Carol, Dave, Alice
        Bob, Dave, Alice, Carol
        Carol, Alice, Dave, Bob
        Carol, Dave, Alice, Bob
        Carol, Dave, Bob, Alice
        Dave, Alice, Bob, Carol
        Dave, Carol, Alice, Bob
        Dave, Carol, Bob, Alice

    If *r* is given, only the *r*-length derangements are yielded.

        >>> sorted(derangements(range(3), 2))
        [(1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 0)]
        >>> sorted(derangements([0, 2, 3], 2))
        [(2, 0), (2, 3), (3, 0)]

    Elements are treated as unique based on their position, not on their value.

    Consider the Secret Santa example with two *different* people who have
    the *same* name. Then there are two valid gift assignments even though
    it might appear that a person is assigned to themselves:

        >>> names = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Bob']
        >>> list(derangements(names))
        [('Bob', 'Bob', 'Alice'), ('Bob', 'Alice', 'Bob')]

    To avoid confusion, make the inputs distinct:

        >>> deduped = [f'{name}{index}' for index, name in enumerate(names)]
        >>> list(derangements(deduped))
        [('Bob1', 'Bob2', 'Alice0'), ('Bob2', 'Alice0', 'Bob1')]

    The number of derangements of a set of size *n* is known as the
    "subfactorial of n".  For n > 0, the subfactorial is:
    ``round(math.factorial(n) / math.e)``.
