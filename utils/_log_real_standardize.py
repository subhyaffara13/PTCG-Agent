    The logarithm of a real number may be represented by a complex number with
    imaginary part that is a multiple of pi*1j. Even multiples correspond with
    a positive real and odd multiples correspond with a negative real.

    Given a logarithm of a real number `x`, this function returns an equivalent
    representation in a standard form: the log of a positive real has imaginary
    part `0` and the log of a negative real has imaginary part `pi`.
