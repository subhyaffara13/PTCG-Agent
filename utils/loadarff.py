def loadarff(f):
    """
    Read an arff file.

    The data is returned as a record array, which can be accessed much like
    a dictionary of NumPy arrays. For example, if one of the attributes is
    called 'pressure', then its first 10 data points can be accessed from the
    ``data`` record array like so: ``data['pressure'][0:10]``


    Parameters
    ----------
    f : file-like or str
       File-like object to read from, or filename to open.

    Returns
    -------
    data : record array
       The data of the arff file, accessible by attribute names.
    meta : `MetaData`
       Contains information about the arff file such as name and
       type of attributes, the relation (name of the dataset), etc.

    Raises
    ------
    ParseArffError
        This is raised if the given file is not ARFF-formatted.
    NotImplementedError
        The ARFF file has an attribute which is not supported yet.

    Notes
    -----

    This function should be able to read most arff files. Not
    implemented functionality include:

    * date type attributes
    * string type attributes

    It can read files with numeric and nominal attributes. It cannot read
    files with sparse data ({} in the file). However, this function can
    read files with missing data (? in the file), representing the data
    points as NaNs.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from scipy.io import arff
    >>> from io import StringIO
    >>> content = \"\"\"
    ... @relation foo
    ... @attribute width  numeric
    ... @attribute height numeric
    ... @attribute color  {red,green,blue,yellow,black}
    ... @data
    ... 5.0,3.25,blue
    ... 4.5,3.75,green
    ... 3.0,4.00,red
    ... \"\"\"
    >>> f = StringIO(content)
    >>> data, meta = arff.loadarff(f)
    >>> data
    array([(5.0, 3.25, 'blue'), (4.5, 3.75, 'green'), (3.0, 4.0, 'red')],
          dtype=[('width', '<f8'), ('height', '<f8'), ('color', '|S6')])
    >>> meta
    Dataset: foo
    \twidth's type is numeric
    \theight's type is numeric
    \tcolor's type is nominal, range is ('red', 'green', 'blue', 'yellow', 'black')
