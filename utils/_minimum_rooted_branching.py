    """Helper function to compute a minimum rooted branching (aka rooted
    arborescence)

    Before the branching can be computed, the directed graph must be rooted by
    removing the predecessors of root.

    A branching / arborescence of rooted graph G is a subgraph that contains a
    directed path from the root to every other vertex. It is the directed
    analog of the minimum spanning tree problem.
