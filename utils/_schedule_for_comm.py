    Schedule `snodes` for various comm optimization objectives.

    Args:
        snodes: the nodes to be scheduled.
        raise_comms: whether to greedily schedule collectives as early as possible
        sink_wait: whether to greedily schedule waits as late as possible
        reorder_compute_for_overlap: whether to reorder compute nodes to
            optimize for compute/communication overlapping.

    Returns:
        The new schedule order.

    Some notes on the synergy between different options:
        - `raise_comms` provides more overlapping oppurtunies for `reorder_compute_for_overlap`.
        - When both `raise_comms` and `sink_waits` is `True`, `raise_comms` is prioritized.

    # We assign each node a tuple of scores (score_0, score_1, score_2),
    # decreasing in importance, with a lower value indicating a higher ranking:
    #
    # - score_0: the lowest comm_idx among the comm nodes that the node blocks.
    # If a node doesn't block any comm nodes, its score_0 is set to
    # sys.maxsize. This score ensures that comm nodes get scheduled as early as
    # possible.
    # - score_1: 1 if the node is a wait node, 0 otherwise. This score ensures
    # that wait nodes are deferred as late as possible.
    # - score_2: the index of the node in the original topological order. This
    # score provides stability in case of ties.
    #
    # When only raise_comms is True, only score_0 and score_2 are considered.
    # When only sink_waits is True, only score_1 and score_2 are considered.
    # When neither is True, the original order is yielded.
