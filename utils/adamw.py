  r"""Adam with weight decay regularization.

  AdamW uses weight decay to regularize learning towards small weights, as
  this leads to better generalization. In SGD you can also use L2 regularization
  to implement this as an additive loss term, however L2 regularization
  does not behave as intended for adaptive gradient algorithms such as Adam,
  see [Loshchilov et al, 2019].

  Let :math:`\alpha_t` represent the learning rate and :math:`\beta_1, \beta_2`,
  :math:`\varepsilon`, :math:`\bar{\varepsilon}` represent the arguments
  ``b1``, ``b2``, ``eps`` and ``eps_root`` respectively. The learning rate is
  indexed by :math:`t` since the learning rate may also be provided by a
  schedule function. Let :math:`\lambda` be the weight decay and
  :math:`\theta_t` the parameter vector at time :math:`t`.

  The ``init`` function of this optimizer initializes an internal state
  :math:`S_0 := (m_0, v_0) = (0, 0)`, representing initial estimates for the
  first and second moments. In practice these values are stored as pytrees
  containing all zeros, with the same shape as the model updates.
  At step :math:`t`, the ``update`` function of this optimizer takes as
  arguments the incoming gradients :math:`g_t`, the optimizer state :math:`S_t`
  and the parameters :math:`\theta_t` and computes updates :math:`u_t` and
  new state :math:`S_{t+1}`. Thus, for :math:`t > 0`, we have,

  .. math::

    \begin{align*}
      m_t &\leftarrow \beta_1 \cdot m_{t-1} + (1-\beta_1) \cdot g_t \\
      v_t &\leftarrow \beta_2 \cdot v_{t-1} + (1-\beta_2) \cdot {g_t}^2 \\
      \hat{m}_t &\leftarrow m_t / {(1-\beta_1^t)} \\
      \hat{v}_t &\leftarrow v_t / {(1-\beta_2^t)} \\
      u_t &\leftarrow -\alpha_t \cdot \left( \hat{m}_t / \left({\sqrt{\hat{v}_t
      + \bar{\varepsilon}} + \varepsilon} \right) + \lambda \theta_{t} \right)\\
      S_t &\leftarrow (m_t, v_t).
    \end{align*}

  This implementation can incorporate a momentum a la Nesterov introduced by
  [Dozat 2016]. The resulting optimizer is then often referred as NAdamW.
  With the keyword argument `nesterov=True`, the optimizer uses Nesterov
  momentum, replacing the above :math:`\hat{m}_t` with

  .. math::
      \hat{m}_t \leftarrow
        \beta_1 m_t / {(1-\beta_1^{t+1})} + (1 - \beta_1) g_t / {(1-\beta_1^t)}.

  Args:
    learning_rate: A global scaling factor, either fixed or evolving along
      iterations with a scheduler, see :func:`optax.scale_by_learning_rate`.
    b1: Exponential decay rate to track the first moment of past gradients.
    b2: Exponential decay rate to track the second moment of past gradients.
    eps: A small constant applied to denominator outside of the square root
      (as in the Adam paper) to avoid dividing by zero when rescaling.
    eps_root: A small constant applied to denominator inside the square root (as
      in RMSProp), to avoid dividing by zero when rescaling. This is needed for
      instance when computing (meta-)gradients through Adam.
    mu_dtype: Optional `dtype` to be used for the first order accumulator; if
      `None` then the `dtype` is inferred from `params` and `updates`.
    weight_decay: Strength of the weight decay regularization. Note that this
      weight decay is multiplied with the learning rate. This is consistent
      with other frameworks such as PyTorch, but different from
      (Loshchilov et al, 2019) where the weight decay is only multiplied with
      the "schedule multiplier", but not the base learning rate.
    mask: A tree with same structure as (or a prefix of) the params PyTree,
      or a Callable that returns such a pytree given the params/updates.
      The leaves should be booleans, `True` for leaves/subtrees you want to
      apply the weight decay to, and `False` for those you want to skip. Note
      that the Adam gradient transformations are applied to all parameters.
    nesterov: Whether to use Nesterov momentum. The solver with
      nesterov=True is equivalent to the :func:`optax.nadamw` optimizer. This
      modification is described in [Dozat 2016].

  Returns:
    The corresponding :class:`optax.GradientTransformationExtraArgs`.

  Examples:
    >>> import optax
    >>> import jax
    >>> import jax.numpy as jnp
    >>> def f(x): return jnp.sum(x ** 2)  # simple quadratic function
    >>> solver = optax.adamw(learning_rate=0.003)
    >>> params = jnp.array([1., 2., 3.])
    >>> print('Objective function: ', f(params))
    Objective function:  14.0
    >>> opt_state = solver.init(params)
    >>> for _ in range(5):
    ...  grad = jax.grad(f)(params)
    ...  updates, opt_state = solver.update(grad, opt_state, params)
    ...  params = optax.apply_updates(params, updates)
    ...  print('Objective function: {:.2E}'.format(f(params)))
    Objective function: 1.40E+01
    Objective function: 1.39E+01
    Objective function: 1.39E+01
    Objective function: 1.39E+01
    Objective function: 1.38E+01
