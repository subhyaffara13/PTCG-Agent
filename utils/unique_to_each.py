def unique_to_each(*iterables):
    """Return the elements from each of the input iterables that aren't in the
    other input iterables.

    For example, suppose you have a set of packages, each with a set of
    dependencies::

        {'pkg_1': {'A', 'B'}, 'pkg_2': {'B', 'C'}, 'pkg_3': {'B', 'D'}}

    If you remove one package, which dependencies can also be removed?

    If ``pkg_1`` is removed, then ``A`` is no longer necessary - it is not
    associated with ``pkg_2`` or ``pkg_3``. Similarly, ``C`` is only needed for
    ``pkg_2``, and ``D`` is only needed for ``pkg_3``::

        >>> unique_to_each({'A', 'B'}, {'B', 'C'}, {'B', 'D'})
        [['A'], ['C'], ['D']]

    If there are duplicates in one input iterable that aren't in the others
    they will be duplicated in the output. Input order is preserved::

        >>> unique_to_each("mississippi", "missouri")
        [['p', 'p'], ['o', 'u', 'r']]

    It is assumed that the elements of each iterable are hashable.
