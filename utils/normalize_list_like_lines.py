    """
    Normalize lines in the given text that resemble list items. The function looks for lines that start optionally with
    '-' or '*', possibly followed by Roman numerals or digits indicating nesting levels. The function reformats such
    lines to make them more structured.

    Args:
        generation (str): The input text containing lines that need to be normalized.

    Returns:
        str: The input text with the list-like lines normalized.

    Note:
        The function uses regular expressions to identify and reformat the list-like lines. The patterns capture
        optional bullet points, nesting levels indicated by numerals, and the actual list item content. The
        normalization adjusts the bullet point style and nesting levels based on the captured patterns.
