def f5_reduce(f, B):
    """
    F5-reduce a labeled polynomial f by B.

    Continuously searches for non-zero labeled polynomial h in B, such
    that the leading term lt_h of h divides the leading term lt_f of
    f and Sign(lt_h * h) < Sign(f). If such a labeled polynomial h is
    found, f gets replaced by f - lt_f / lt_h * h. If no such h can be
    found or f is 0, f is no further F5-reducible and f gets returned.

    A polynomial that is reducible in the usual sense need not be
    F5-reducible, e.g.:

    >>> from sympy.polys.groebnertools import lbp, sig, f5_reduce, Polyn
    >>> from sympy.polys import ring, QQ, lex

    >>> R, x,y,z = ring("x,y,z", QQ, lex)

    >>> f = lbp(sig((1, 1, 1), 4), x, 3)
    >>> g = lbp(sig((0, 0, 0), 2), x, 2)

    >>> Polyn(f).rem([Polyn(g)])
    0
    >>> f5_reduce(f, [g])
    (((1, 1, 1), 4), x, 3)
