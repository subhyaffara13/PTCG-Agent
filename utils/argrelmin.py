def argrelmin(data, axis=0, order=1, mode='clip'):
    """
    Calculate the relative minima of `data`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : ndarray
        Array in which to find the relative minima.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis over which to select from `data`. Default is 0.
    order : int, optional
        How many points on each side to use for the comparison
        to consider ``comparator(n, n+x)`` to be True.
    mode : str, optional
        How the edges of the vector are treated.
        Available options are 'wrap' (wrap around) or 'clip' (treat overflow
        as the same as the last (or first) element).
        Default 'clip'. See numpy.take.

    Returns
    -------
    extrema : tuple of ndarrays
        Indices of the minima in arrays of integers. ``extrema[k]`` is
        the array of indices of axis `k` of `data`. Note that the
        return value is a tuple even when `data` is 1-D.

    --------
    argrelextrema, argrelmax, find_peaks

    Notes
    -----
    This function uses `argrelextrema` with np.less as comparator. Therefore, it
    requires a strict inequality on both sides of a value to consider it a
    minimum. This means flat minima (more than one sample wide) are not detected.
    In case of 1-D `data` `find_peaks` can be used to detect all
    local minima, including flat ones, by calling it with negated `data`.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from scipy.signal import argrelmin
    >>> x = np.array([2, 1, 2, 3, 2, 0, 1, 0])
    >>> argrelmin(x)
    (array([1, 5]),)
    >>> y = np.array([[1, 2, 1, 2],
    ...               [2, 2, 0, 0],
    ...               [5, 3, 4, 4]])
    ...
    >>> argrelmin(y, axis=1)
    (array([0, 2]), array([2, 1]))
