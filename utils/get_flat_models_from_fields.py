    Take a list of Pydantic  ``ModelField``s (from a model) that could have been declared as subclasses of ``BaseModel``
    (so, any of them could be a submodel), and generate a set with their models and all the sub-models in the tree.
    I.e. if you pass a the fields of a model ``Foo`` (subclass of ``BaseModel``) as ``fields``, and on of them has a
    field of type ``Bar`` (also subclass of ``BaseModel``) and that model ``Bar`` has a field of type ``Baz`` (also
    subclass of ``BaseModel``), the return value will be ``set([Foo, Bar, Baz])``.

    :return: a set with any model declared in the fields, and all their sub-models
