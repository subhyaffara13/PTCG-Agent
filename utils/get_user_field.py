    A utility function that asks a question to the user to get an answer, potentially looping until it gets a valid
    answer.

    Args:
        question (`str`):
            The question to ask the user.
        default_value (`str`, *optional*):
            A potential default value that will be used when the answer is empty.
        convert_to (`Callable`, *optional*):
            If set, the answer will be passed to this function. If this function raises an error on the provided
            answer, the question will be asked again.
        fallback_message (`str`, *optional*):
            A message that will be displayed each time the question is asked again to the user.

    Returns:
        `Any`: The answer provided by the user (or the default), passed through the potential conversion function.
