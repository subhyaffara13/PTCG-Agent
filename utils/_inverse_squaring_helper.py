def _inverse_squaring_helper(T0, theta):
    """
    A helper function for inverse scaling and squaring for Pade approximation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    T0 : (N, N) array_like upper triangular
        Matrix involved in inverse scaling and squaring.
    theta : indexable
        The values theta[1] .. theta[7] must be available.
        They represent bounds related to Pade approximation, and they depend
        on the matrix function which is being computed.
        For example, different values of theta are required for
        matrix logarithm than for fractional matrix power.

    Returns
    -------
    R : (N, N) array_like upper triangular
        Composition of zero or more matrix square roots of T0, minus I.
    s : non-negative integer
        Number of square roots taken.
    m : positive integer
        The degree of the Pade approximation.

    Notes
    -----
    This subroutine appears as a chunk of lines within
    a couple of published algorithms; for example it appears
    as lines 4--35 in algorithm (3.1) of [1]_, and
    as lines 3--34 in algorithm (4.1) of [2]_.
    The instances of 'goto line 38' in algorithm (3.1) of [1]_
    probably mean 'goto line 36' and have been interpreted accordingly.
