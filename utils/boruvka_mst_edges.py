    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX Graph
        The edges of `G` must have distinct weights,
        otherwise the edges may not form a tree.

    minimum : bool (default: True)
        Find the minimum (True) or maximum (False) spanning tree.

    weight : string (default: 'weight')
        The name of the edge attribute holding the edge weights.

    keys : bool (default: True)
        This argument is ignored since this function is not
        implemented for multigraphs; it exists only for consistency
        with the other minimum spanning tree functions.

    data : bool (default: True)
        Flag for whether to yield edge attribute dicts.
        If True, yield edges `(u, v, d)`, where `d` is the attribute dict.
        If False, yield edges `(u, v)`.

    ignore_nan : bool (default: False)
        If a NaN is found as an edge weight normally an exception is raised.
        If `ignore_nan is True` then that edge is ignored instead.
