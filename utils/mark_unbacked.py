    Mark a tensor as having an unbacked dimension. This changes the semantics of operations:
    - The size of the specified dimension will always be reported as not equal to zero or one.
    - Assertions on this index will be turned into runtime asserts.
    - Attempting to get the real value of this dimension will raise an exception.
    - In effect, this dimension is treated as data-dependent (its value is unknown).

    Args:
        t (Any): The tensor to mark as having an unbacked dimension.
        index (int or list/tuple of int): The dimension(s) to mark as unbacked. Can be a single integer or a list/tuple of integers.
        hint_override (Optional[int], default=None): An optional integer to override the size hint for this dimension.
            This is only used by the inductor backend for size hint queries, such as during autotuning.
            NOTE: changing hint_override values will cause FxGraphCache misses, since hint overrides
            affect inductor codegen decisions and are included in the cache key via
            ShapeEnv.var_to_hint_override.
        strict (bool, default=False): If True, an error will be raised if the unbacked dimension is specialized.
            By default (strict=False), specialization is allowed and will proceed without error.
        specialize_on (Optional[list[Any]], default=None): A list of specialization criteria (e.g., lambdas) for this dimension.
            If provided, Dynamo will generate specialized compiled regions for each criterion in addition to a generic trace.
        shape_id (Optional[str], default=None): An optional identifier to group unbacked dimensions together.
            All unbacked dimensions with the same shape_id will share the same unbacked symbol. This is useful when multiple tensors
            are known to have the same batch size at runtime. A runtime assertion is added
            to ensure this property at runtime.
        min (Optional[int], default=None): Minimum value constraint for this dimension.
            If provided, a runtime check will be added to ensure the dimension is >= min.
        max (Optional[int], default=None): Maximum value constraint for this dimension.
            If provided, a runtime check will be added to ensure the dimension is <= max.
