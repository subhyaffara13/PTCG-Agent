    Parametric Risch Differential Equation - Generate linear constraints on the constants.

    Explanation
    ===========

    Given a derivation D on k[t], a, b, in k[t] with gcd(a, b) == 1, and
    G = [g1, ..., gm] in k(t)^m, return Q = [q1, ..., qm] in k[t]^m and a
    matrix M with entries in k(t) such that for any solution c1, ..., cm in
    Const(k) and p in k[t] of a*Dp + b*p == Sum(ci*gi, (i, 1, m)),
    (c1, ..., cm) is a solution of Mx == 0, and p and the ci satisfy
    a*Dp + b*p == Sum(ci*qi, (i, 1, m)).

    Because M has entries in k(t), and because Matrix does not play well with
    Poly, M will be a Matrix of Basic expressions.
