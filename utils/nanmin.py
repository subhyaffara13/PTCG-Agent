    """
    Return minimum of an array or minimum along an axis, ignoring any NaNs.
    When all-NaN slices are encountered a ``RuntimeWarning`` is raised and
    Nan is returned for that slice.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Array containing numbers whose minimum is desired. If `a` is not an
        array, a conversion is attempted.
    axis : {int, tuple of int, None}, optional
        Axis or axes along which the minimum is computed. The default is to compute
        the minimum of the flattened array.
    out : ndarray, optional
        Alternate output array in which to place the result.  The default
        is ``None``; if provided, it must have the same shape as the
        expected output, but the type will be cast if necessary. See
        :ref:`ufuncs-output-type` for more details.
    keepdims : bool, optional
        If this is set to True, the axes which are reduced are left
        in the result as dimensions with size one. With this option,
        the result will broadcast correctly against the original `a`.

        If the value is anything but the default, then
        `keepdims` will be passed through to the `min` method
        of sub-classes of `ndarray`.  If the sub-classes methods
        does not implement `keepdims` any exceptions will be raised.
    initial : scalar, optional
        The maximum value of an output element. Must be present to allow
        computation on empty slice. See `~numpy.ufunc.reduce` for details.

        .. versionadded:: 1.22.0
    where : array_like of bool, optional
        Elements to compare for the minimum. See `~numpy.ufunc.reduce`
        for details.

        .. versionadded:: 1.22.0

    Returns
    -------
    nanmin : ndarray
        An array with the same shape as `a`, with the specified axis
        removed.  If `a` is a 0-d array, or if axis is None, an ndarray
        scalar is returned.  The same dtype as `a` is returned.

    See Also
    --------
    nanmax :
        The maximum value of an array along a given axis, ignoring any NaNs.
    amin :
        The minimum value of an array along a given axis, propagating any NaNs.
    fmin :
        Element-wise minimum of two arrays, ignoring any NaNs.
    minimum :
        Element-wise minimum of two arrays, propagating any NaNs.
    isnan :
        Shows which elements are Not a Number (NaN).
    isfinite:
        Shows which elements are neither NaN nor infinity.

    amax, fmax, maximum

    Notes
    -----
    NumPy uses the IEEE Standard for Binary Floating-Point for Arithmetic
    (IEEE 754). This means that Not a Number is not equivalent to infinity.
    Positive infinity is treated as a very large number and negative
    infinity is treated as a very small (i.e. negative) number.

    If the input has a integer type the function is equivalent to np.min.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, np.nan]])
    >>> np.nanmin(a)
    1.0
    >>> np.nanmin(a, axis=0)
    array([1.,  2.])
    >>> np.nanmin(a, axis=1)
    array([1.,  3.])

    When positive infinity and negative infinity are present:

    >>> np.nanmin([1, 2, np.nan, np.inf])
    1.0
    >>> np.nanmin([1, 2, np.nan, -np.inf])
    -inf

           where: ArrayLike | None = None) -> Array:
  r"""Return the minimum of the array elements along a given axis, ignoring NaNs.

  JAX implementation of :func:`numpy.nanmin`.

  Args:
    a: Input array.
    axis: int or sequence of ints, default=None. Axis along which the minimum is
      computed. If None, the minimum is computed along the flattened array.
    keepdims: bool, default=False. If True, reduced axes are left in the result
      with size 1.
    initial: int or array, default=None. Initial value for the minimum.
    where: array of boolean dtype, default=None. The elements to be used in the
      minimum. Array should be broadcast compatible to the input. ``initial``
      must be specified when ``where`` is used.
    out: Unused by JAX.

  Returns:
    An array of minimum values along the given axis, ignoring NaNs. If all values
    are NaNs along the given axis, returns ``nan``.

  See also:
    - :func:`jax.numpy.nanmax`: Compute the maximum of array elements along a
      given axis, ignoring NaNs.
    - :func:`jax.numpy.nansum`: Compute the sum of array elements along a given
      axis, ignoring NaNs.
    - :func:`jax.numpy.nanprod`: Compute the product of array elements along a
      given axis, ignoring NaNs.
    - :func:`jax.numpy.nanmean`: Compute the mean of array elements along a given
      axis, ignoring NaNs.

  Examples:

    By default, ``jnp.nanmin`` computes the minimum of elements along the flattened
    array.

    >>> nan = jnp.nan
    >>> x = jnp.array([[1, nan, 4, 5],
    ...                [nan, -2, nan, -4],
    ...                [2, 1, 3, nan]])
    >>> jnp.nanmin(x)
    Array(-4., dtype=float32)

    If ``axis=1``, the maximum will be computed along axis 1.

    >>> jnp.nanmin(x, axis=1)
    Array([ 1., -4.,  1.], dtype=float32)

    If ``keepdims=True``, ``ndim`` of the output will be same of that of the input.

    >>> jnp.nanmin(x, axis=1, keepdims=True)
    Array([[ 1.],
           [-4.],
           [ 1.]], dtype=float32)

    To include only specific elements in computing the maximum, you can use
    ``where``. It can either have same dimension as input

    >>> where=jnp.array([[0, 0, 1, 0],
    ...                  [0, 0, 1, 1],
    ...                  [1, 1, 1, 0]], dtype=bool)
    >>> jnp.nanmin(x, axis=1, keepdims=True, initial=0, where=where)
    Array([[ 0.],
           [-4.],
           [ 0.]], dtype=float32)

    or must be broadcast compatible with input.

    >>> where = jnp.array([[False],
    ...                    [True],
    ...                    [False]])
    >>> jnp.nanmin(x, axis=0, keepdims=True, initial=0, where=where)
    Array([[ 0., -2.,  0., -4.]], dtype=float32)
