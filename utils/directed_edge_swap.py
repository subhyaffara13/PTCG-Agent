def directed_edge_swap(G, *, nswap=1, max_tries=100, seed=None):
    """Swap three edges in a directed graph while keeping the node degrees fixed.

    A directed edge swap swaps three edges such that a -> b -> c -> d becomes
    a -> c -> b -> d. This pattern of swapping allows all possible states with the
    same in- and out-degree distribution in a directed graph to be reached.

    If the swap would create parallel edges (e.g. if a -> c already existed in the
    previous example), another attempt is made to find a suitable trio of edges.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : DiGraph
       A directed graph

    nswap : integer (optional, default=1)
       Number of three-edge (directed) swaps to perform

    max_tries : integer (optional, default=100)
       Maximum number of attempts to swap edges

    seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
        Indicator of random number generation state.
        See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.

    Returns
    -------
    G : DiGraph
       The graph after the edges are swapped.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        If `G` is not directed, or
        If nswap > max_tries, or
        If there are fewer than 4 nodes or 3 edges in `G`.
    NetworkXAlgorithmError
        If the number of swap attempts exceeds `max_tries` before `nswap` swaps are made

    Notes
    -----
    Does not enforce any connectivity constraints.

    The graph G is modified in place.

    A later swap is allowed to undo a previous swap.
