def transitive_reduction(G):
    """Returns transitive reduction of a directed graph

    The transitive reduction of G = (V,E) is a graph G- = (V,E-) such that
    for all v,w in V there is an edge (v,w) in E- if and only if (v,w) is
    in E and there is no path from v to w in G with length greater than 1.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX DiGraph
        A directed acyclic graph (DAG)

    Returns
    -------
    NetworkX DiGraph
        The transitive reduction of `G`

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        If `G` is not a directed acyclic graph (DAG) transitive reduction is
        not uniquely defined and a :exc:`NetworkXError` exception is raised.

    Examples
    --------
    To perform transitive reduction on a DiGraph:

    >>> DG = nx.DiGraph([(1, 2), (2, 3), (1, 3)])
    >>> TR = nx.transitive_reduction(DG)
    >>> list(TR.edges)
    [(1, 2), (2, 3)]

    To avoid unnecessary data copies, this implementation does not return a
    DiGraph with node/edge data.
    To perform transitive reduction on a DiGraph and transfer node/edge data:

    >>> DG = nx.DiGraph()
    >>> DG.add_edges_from([(1, 2), (2, 3), (1, 3)], color="red")
    >>> TR = nx.transitive_reduction(DG)
    >>> TR.add_nodes_from(DG.nodes(data=True))
    >>> TR.add_edges_from((u, v, DG.edges[u, v]) for u, v in TR.edges)
    >>> list(TR.edges(data=True))
    [(1, 2, {'color': 'red'}), (2, 3, {'color': 'red'})]
