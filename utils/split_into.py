def split_into(iterable, sizes):
    """Yield a list of sequential items from *iterable* of length 'n' for each
    integer 'n' in *sizes*.

        >>> list(split_into([1,2,3,4,5,6], [1,2,3]))
        [[1], [2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]

    If the sum of *sizes* is smaller than the length of *iterable*, then the
    remaining items of *iterable* will not be returned.

        >>> list(split_into([1,2,3,4,5,6], [2,3]))
        [[1, 2], [3, 4, 5]]

    If the sum of *sizes* is larger than the length of *iterable*, fewer items
    will be returned in the iteration that overruns the *iterable* and further
    lists will be empty:

        >>> list(split_into([1,2,3,4], [1,2,3,4]))
        [[1], [2, 3], [4], []]

    When a ``None`` object is encountered in *sizes*, the returned list will
    contain items up to the end of *iterable* the same way that
    :func:`itertools.slice` does:

        >>> list(split_into([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0], [2,3,None]))
        [[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9, 0]]

    :func:`split_into` can be useful for grouping a series of items where the
    sizes of the groups are not uniform. An example would be where in a row
    from a table, multiple columns represent elements of the same feature
    (e.g. a point represented by x,y,z) but, the format is not the same for
    all columns.
    """
    # convert the iterable argument into an iterator so its contents can
    # be consumed by islice in case it is a generator
    it = iter(iterable)

    for size in sizes:
        if size is None:
            yield list(it)
            return
        else:
            yield list(islice(it, size))
