def periphery(G, e=None, usebounds=False, weight=None):
    """Returns the periphery of the graph G.

    The periphery is the set of nodes with eccentricity equal to the diameter.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
       A graph

    e : eccentricity dictionary, optional
      A precomputed dictionary of eccentricities.

    usebounds : bool, optional
        If `True`, use extrema bounding (see Notes) when computing the periphery
        for undirected graphs. Extrema bounding may accelerate the
        distance calculation for some graphs. `usebounds` is ignored if `G` is
        directed or if `e` is not `None`. Default is `False`.

    weight : string, function, or None
        If this is a string, then edge weights will be accessed via the
        edge attribute with this key (that is, the weight of the edge
        joining `u` to `v` will be ``G.edges[u, v][weight]``). If no
        such edge attribute exists, the weight of the edge is assumed to
        be one.

        If this is a function, the weight of an edge is the value
        returned by the function. The function must accept exactly three
        positional arguments: the two endpoints of an edge and the
        dictionary of edge attributes for that edge. The function must
        return a number.

        If this is None, every edge has weight/distance/cost 1.

        Weights stored as floating point values can lead to small round-off
        errors in distances. Use integer weights to avoid this.

        Weights should be positive, since they are distances.

    Returns
    -------
    p : list
       List of nodes in periphery

    Notes
    -----
    When ``usebounds=True``, the computation makes use of smart lower
    and upper bounds and is often linear in the number of nodes, rather than
    quadratic (except for some border cases such as complete graphs or circle
    shaped-graphs).

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.Graph([(1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 4), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)])
    >>> nx.periphery(G)
    [2, 5]
