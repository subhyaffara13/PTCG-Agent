    # In general, we need to disambiguate the HIPified filename so that
    # it gets a different name from the original filename, so
    # that we don't overwrite the original file
    #
    # There's a lot of different naming conventions across PyTorch,
    # but the general recipe is to convert occurrences
    # of cuda/gpu to hip, and add hip if there are no occurrences
    # of cuda/gpu anywhere.
    #
    # Concretely, we do the following:
    #
    #   - If there is a directory component named "cuda", replace
    #     it with "hip", AND
    #
    #   - If the file name contains "CUDA", replace it with "HIP", AND
    #
    #   - ALWAYS replace '.cu' with '.hip', because those files
    #     contain CUDA kernels that needs to be hipified and processed with
    #     hip compiler
    #
    #   - If we are not hipifying a PyTorch extension, and the parent
    #     directory name did not change as a result of the above
    #     transformations, insert "hip" in the file path
    #     as the direct parent folder of the file
    #
    #   - If we are hipifying a PyTorch extension, and the parent directory
    #     name as well as the filename (incl. extension) did not change as
    #     a result of the above transformations, insert "_hip" in the filename
    #
    # This isn't set in stone; we might adjust this to support other
    # naming conventions.
