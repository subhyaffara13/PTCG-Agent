def solve_discrete_lyapunov(a, q, method=None):
    """
    Solves the discrete Lyapunov equation :math:`AXA^H - X + Q = 0`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    a, q : (M, M) array_like
        Square matrices corresponding to A and Q in the equation
        above respectively. Must have the same shape.

    method : {'direct', 'bilinear'}, optional
        Type of solver.

        If not given, chosen to be ``direct`` if ``M`` is less than 10 and
        ``bilinear`` otherwise.

    Returns
    -------
    x : ndarray
        Solution to the discrete Lyapunov equation

    See Also
    --------
    solve_continuous_lyapunov : computes the solution to the continuous-time
        Lyapunov equation

    Notes
    -----
    This section describes the available solvers that can be selected by the
    'method' parameter. The default method is *direct* if ``M`` is less than 10
    and ``bilinear`` otherwise.

    Method *direct* uses a direct analytical solution to the discrete Lyapunov
    equation. The algorithm is given in, for example, [1]_. However, it requires
    the linear solution of a system with dimension :math:`M^2` so that
    performance degrades rapidly for even moderately sized matrices.

    Method *bilinear* uses a bilinear transformation to convert the discrete
    Lyapunov equation to a continuous Lyapunov equation :math:`(BX+XB'=-C)`
    where :math:`B=(A-I)(A+I)^{-1}` and
    :math:`C=2(A' + I)^{-1} Q (A + I)^{-1}`. The continuous equation can be
    efficiently solved since it is a special case of a Sylvester equation.
    The transformation algorithm is from Popov (1964) as described in [2]_.

    >>> q = np.eye(2)

           [ 1.43518822, -2.4266315 ]])
