    Registers the given type as an opaque type which allows this to be consumed
    by a custom operator.

    The type name will be automatically generated from the class's fully
    qualified name (ex. my_module.MyClass).

    Args:
        cls (type): The class to register as an opaque type.
        typ (str): Either "reference" or "value". See Note [Opaque Objects] for
            more details.
        hoist (bool): Only applies to value types. A hoist=True value type
            object is lifted as an input to the torch.compile'd graph, instead
            of being a constant baked into the graph. This is useful to
            improve compilation times in hierarchical compilation
            (e.g., change your custom ops to use hoisted strings to avoid
            baking the string into the Dynamo/AOTAutograd/FX graphs).
            This flag does nothing for reference types.
        guard_fn (callable | None): A function that takes an instance of the opaque
            object and returns a list of values to guard on. These values will be compared
            for equality on each function call, triggering recompilation if they change.
            Only applicable for reference types.
            Example: lambda obj: [obj.x, obj.y]
        members (dict[str, MemberType] | None): Dictionary mapping member names
            (attributes, properties, or methods) to their MemberType, which controls
            how they are handled during torch.compile tracing:
            - MemberType.USE_REAL: Evaluates with the real object at compile time and
              bakes the result as a constant
            - MemberType.INLINED: Inlines the method call into the trace
