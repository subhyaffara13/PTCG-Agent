    Generates validation function for validating JSON schema passed in ``definition``.
    Example:

    .. code-block:: python

        import fastjsonschema

        validate = fastjsonschema.compile({'type': 'string'})
        validate('hello')

    This implementation supports keyword ``default`` (can be turned off
    by passing `use_default=False`):

    .. code-block:: python

        validate = fastjsonschema.compile({
            'type': 'object',
            'properties': {

            },
        })

        data = validate({})
        assert data == {'a': 42}

    Supported implementations are draft-04, draft-06 and draft-07. Which version
    should be used is determined by `$draft` in your ``definition``. When not
    specified, the latest implementation is used (draft-07).

    .. code-block:: python

        validate = fastjsonschema.compile({
            '$schema': 'http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema',
            'type': 'number',
        })

    You can pass mapping from URI to function that should be used to retrieve
    remote schemes used in your ``definition`` in parameter ``handlers``.

    Also, you can pass mapping for custom formats. Key is the name of your
    formatter and value can be regular expression, which will be compiled or
    callback returning `bool` (or you can raise your own exception).

    .. code-block:: python

        validate = fastjsonschema.compile(definition, formats={
            'foo': r'foo|bar',
            'bar': lambda value: value in ('foo', 'bar'),
        })

    Note that formats are automatically used as assertions. It can be turned
    off by passing `use_formats=False`. When disabled, custom formats are
    disabled as well. (Added in 2.19.0.)

    If you don't need detailed exceptions, you can turn the details off and gain
    additional performance by passing `detailed_exceptions=False`.

    Exception :any:`JsonSchemaDefinitionException` is raised when generating the
    code fails (bad definition).

    Exception :any:`JsonSchemaValueException` is raised from generated function when
    validation fails (data do not follow the definition).

    Optimizes given model/function using TorchDynamo and specified backend.
    If you are compiling an :class:`torch.nn.Module`, you can also use :meth:`torch.nn.Module.compile`
    to compile the module inplace without changing its structure.

    Concretely, for every frame executed within the compiled region, we will attempt
    to compile it and cache the compiled result on the code object for future
    use.  A single frame may be compiled multiple times if previous compiled
    results are not applicable for subsequent calls (this is called a "guard
    failure"), you can use TORCH_LOGS=guards to debug these situations.
    Multiple compiled results can be associated with a frame up to
    ``torch._dynamo.config.recompile_limit``, which defaults to 8; at which
    point we will fall back to eager.  Note that compile caches are per
    *code object*, not frame; if you dynamically create multiple copies of a
    function, they will all share the same code cache.

    Args:
       model (Callable or None): Module/function to optimize
       fullgraph (bool): If False (default), torch.compile attempts to discover compilable regions
        in the function that it will optimize. If True, then we require that the entire function be
        capturable into a single graph. If this is not possible (that is, if there are graph breaks),
        then this will raise an error. This also opts into unbacked semantics, notably it will turn on
        capture_scalar_outputs and capture_dynamic_output_shape_ops on by default.
       dynamic (bool or None): Use dynamic shape tracing.  When this is True, we will up-front attempt
        to generate a kernel that is as dynamic as possible to avoid recompilations when
        sizes change.  This may not always work as some operations/optimizations will
        force specialization; use TORCH_LOGS=dynamic to debug overspecialization.
        When this is False, we will NEVER generate dynamic kernels, we will always specialize.
        By default (None), we automatically detect if dynamism has occurred and compile a more
        dynamic kernel upon recompile.
       backend (str or Callable): backend to be used

        - "inductor" is the default backend, which is a good balance between performance and overhead

        - Non experimental in-tree backends can be seen with `torch._dynamo.list_backends()`

        - Experimental or debug in-tree backends can be seen with `torch._dynamo.list_backends(None)`

        - To register an out-of-tree custom backend:
          https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/main/user_guide/torch_compiler/torch.compiler_custom_backends.html#registering-custom-backends
       mode (str): Can be either "default", "reduce-overhead", "max-autotune" or "max-autotune-no-cudagraphs"

        - "default" is the default mode, which is a good balance between performance and overhead

        - "reduce-overhead" is a mode that reduces the overhead of python with CUDA graphs,
          useful for small batches.  Reduction of overhead can come at the cost of more memory
          usage, as we will cache the workspace memory required for the invocation so that we
          do not have to reallocate it on subsequent runs.  Reduction of overhead is not guaranteed
          to work; today, we only reduce overhead for CUDA only graphs which do not mutate inputs.
          There are other circumstances where CUDA graphs are not applicable; use TORCH_LOGS=perf_hints
          to debug.

        - "max-autotune" is a mode that leverages Triton or template based matrix multiplications
          on supported devices and Triton based convolutions on GPU.
          It enables CUDA graphs by default on GPU.

        - "max-autotune-no-cudagraphs" is a mode similar to "max-autotune" but without CUDA graphs

        - To see the exact configs that each mode sets you can call `torch._inductor.list_mode_options()`

       options (dict): A dictionary of options to pass to the backend. Some notable ones to try out are

        - `epilogue_fusion` which fuses pointwise ops into templates. Requires `max_autotune` to also be set

        - `max_autotune` which will profile to pick the best matmul configuration

        - `fallback_random` which is useful when debugging accuracy issues

        - `shape_padding` which pads matrix shapes to better align loads on GPUs especially for tensor cores

        - `triton.cudagraphs` which will reduce the overhead of python with CUDA graphs

        - `trace.enabled` which is the most useful debugging flag to turn on

        - `trace.graph_diagram` which will show you a picture of your graph after fusion

        - `guard_filter_fn` that controls which dynamo guards are saved with compilations.
          This is an unsafe feature and there is no backward compatibility guarantee provided
          for dynamo guards as data types.
          For stable helper functions to use, see the documentations in `torch.compiler`, for example:
          - `torch.compiler.skip_guard_on_inbuilt_nn_modules_unsafe`
          - `torch.compiler.skip_guard_on_all_nn_modules_unsafe`
          - `torch.compiler.keep_tensor_guards_unsafe`

        - For inductor you can see the full list of configs that it supports by calling `torch._inductor.list_options()`
       name (str or None): Optional identifier for the compiled region. When supported by downstream
        tooling, this is surfaced on wrapped compiled-region higher-order operators and other debug metadata.
       disable (bool): Turn torch.compile() into a no-op for testing

    Example::

        @torch.compile(options={"triton.cudagraphs": True}, fullgraph=True)
        def foo(x):
            return torch.sin(x) + torch.cos(x)
