    """Return ``(o, x, y)`` obtained from the two-phase simplex method
    using Bland's rule: ``o`` is the minimum value of primal,
    ``Cx - D``, under constraints ``Ax <= B`` (with ``x >= 0``) and
    the maximum of the dual, ``y^{T}B - D``, under constraints
    ``A^{T}*y >= C^{T}`` (with ``y >= 0``). To compute the dual of
    the system, pass `dual=True` and ``(o, y, x)`` will be returned.

    Note: the nonnegative constraints for ``x`` and ``y`` supercede
    any values of ``A`` and ``B`` that are inconsistent with that
    assumption, so if a constraint of ``x >= -1`` is represented
    in ``A`` and ``B``, no value will be obtained that is negative; if
    a constraint of ``x <= -1`` is represented, an error will be
    raised since no solution is possible.

    This routine relies on the ability of determining whether an
    expression is 0 or not. This is guaranteed if the input contains
    only Float or Rational entries. It will raise a TypeError if
    a relationship does not evaluate to True or False.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.solvers.simplex import _simplex
    >>> from sympy import Matrix

    Consider the simple minimization of ``f = x + y + 1`` under the
    constraint that ``y + 2*x >= 4``. This is the "standard form" of
    a minimization.

    In the nonnegative quadrant, this inequality describes a area above
    a triangle with vertices at (0, 4), (0, 0) and (2, 0). The minimum
    of ``f`` occurs at (2, 0). Define A, B, C, D for the standard
    minimization:

    >>> A = Matrix([[2, 1]])
    >>> B = Matrix([4])
    >>> C = Matrix([[1, 1]])
    >>> D = Matrix([-1])

    Confirm that this is the system of interest:

    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y
    >>> X = Matrix([x, y])
    >>> (C*X - D)[0]
    x + y + 1
    >>> [i >= j for i, j in zip(A*X, B)]
    [2*x + y >= 4]

    Since `_simplex` will do a minimization for constraints given as
    ``A*x <= B``, the signs of ``A`` and ``B`` must be negated since
    the currently correspond to a greater-than inequality:

    >>> _simplex(-A, -B, C, D)
    (3, [2, 0], [1/2])

    The dual of minimizing ``f`` is maximizing ``F = c*y - d`` for
    ``a*y <= b`` where ``a``, ``b``, ``c``, ``d`` are derived from the
    transpose of the matrix representation of the standard minimization:

    >>> tr = lambda a, b, c, d: [i.T for i in (a, c, b, d)]
    >>> a, b, c, d = tr(A, B, C, D)

    This time ``a*x <= b`` is the expected inequality for the `_simplex`
    method, but to maximize ``F``, the sign of ``c`` and ``d`` must be
    changed (so that minimizing the negative will give the negative of
    the maximum of ``F``):

    >>> _simplex(a, b, -c, -d)
    (-3, [1/2], [2, 0])

    The negative of ``F`` and the min of ``f`` are the same. The dual
    point `[1/2]` is the value of ``y`` that minimized ``F = c*y - d``
    under constraints a*x <= b``:

    >>> y = Matrix(['y'])
    >>> (c*y - d)[0]
    4*y + 1
    >>> [i <= j for i, j in zip(a*y,b)]
    [2*y <= 1, y <= 1]

    In this 1-dimensional dual system, the more restrictive constraint is
    the first which limits ``y`` between 0 and 1/2 and the maximum of
    ``F`` is attained at the nonzero value, hence is ``4*(1/2) + 1 = 3``.

    In this case the values for ``x`` and ``y`` were the same when the
    dual representation was solved. This is not always the case (though
    the value of the function will be the same).

    >>> l = [[1, 1], [-1, 1], [0, 1], [-1, 0]], [5, 1, 2, -1], [[1, 1]], [-1]
    >>> A, B, C, D = [Matrix(i) for i in l]
    >>> _simplex(A, B, -C, -D)
    (-6, [3, 2], [1, 0, 0, 0])
    >>> _simplex(A, B, -C, -D, dual=True)  # [5, 0] != [3, 2]
    (-6, [1, 0, 0, 0], [5, 0])

    In both cases the function has the same value:

    >>> Matrix(C)*Matrix([3, 2]) == Matrix(C)*Matrix([5, 0])
    True
