def is_valid_degree_sequence_erdos_gallai(deg_sequence):
    r"""Returns True if deg_sequence can be realized by a simple graph.

    The validation is done using the Erdős-Gallai theorem [EG1960]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    deg_sequence : list
        A list of integers

    Returns
    -------
    valid : bool
        True if deg_sequence is graphical and False if not.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.Graph([(1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 2), (5, 1), (5, 4)])
    >>> sequence = (d for _, d in G.degree())
    >>> nx.is_valid_degree_sequence_erdos_gallai(sequence)
    True

    To test a non-valid sequence:
    >>> sequence_list = [d for _, d in G.degree()]
    >>> sequence_list[-1] += 1
    >>> nx.is_valid_degree_sequence_erdos_gallai(sequence_list)
    False

    Notes
    -----

    This implementation uses an equivalent form of the Erdős-Gallai criterion.
    Worst-case run time is $O(n)$ where $n$ is the length of the sequence.

    Specifically, a sequence d is graphical if and only if the
    sum of the sequence is even and for all strong indices k in the sequence,

     .. math::

       \sum_{i=1}^{k} d_i \leq k(k-1) + \sum_{j=k+1}^{n} \min(d_i,k)
             = k(n-1) - ( k \sum_{j=0}^{k-1} n_j - \sum_{j=0}^{k-1} j n_j )

    A strong index k is any index where d_k >= k and the value n_j is the
    number of occurrences of j in d.  The maximal strong index is called the
    Durfee index.

    This particular rearrangement comes from the proof of Theorem 3 in [2]_.

    The ZZ condition says that for the sequence d if

    .. math::
        |d| >= \frac{(\max(d) + \min(d) + 1)^2}{4*\min(d)}

    then d is graphical.  This was shown in Theorem 6 in [2]_.
