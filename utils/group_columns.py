def group_columns(A, order=0):
    """Group columns of a 2-D matrix for sparse finite differencing [1]_.

    Two columns are in the same group if in each row at least one of them
    has zero. A greedy sequential algorithm is used to construct groups.

    Parameters
    ----------
    A : array_like or sparse array, shape (m, n)
        Matrix of which to group columns.
    order : int, iterable of int with shape (n,) or None
        Permutation array which defines the order of columns enumeration.
        If int or None, a random permutation is used with `order` used as
        a random seed. Default is 0, that is use a random permutation but
        guarantee repeatability.

    Returns
    -------
    groups : ndarray of int, shape (n,)
        Contains values from 0 to n_groups-1, where n_groups is the number
        of found groups. Each value ``groups[i]`` is an index of a group to
        which ith column assigned. The procedure was helpful only if
        n_groups is significantly less than n.
