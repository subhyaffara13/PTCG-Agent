def dihedral(n):
    """
    Generates the dihedral group of order 2n, Dn.

    The result is given as a subgroup of Sn, except for the special cases n=1
    (the group S2) and n=2 (the Klein 4-group) where that's not possible
    and embeddings in S2 and S4 respectively are given.

    Examples

    >>> from sympy.combinatorics.generators import dihedral
    >>> list(dihedral(3))
    [(2), (0 2), (0 1 2), (1 2), (0 2 1), (2)(0 1)]
