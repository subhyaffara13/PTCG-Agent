    "MemAvailable", see:

    This code reimplements the algorithm outlined here:

    We use this function also when "MemAvailable" returns 0 (possibly a
    kernel bug, see: https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil/issues/1915).
    In that case this routine matches "free" CLI tool result ("available"
    column).

    XXX: on recent kernels this calculation may differ by ~1.5% compared
    to "MemAvailable:", as it's calculated slightly differently.
    It is still way more realistic than doing (free + cached) though.
