    is_busday(
        dates,
        weekmask='1111100',
        holidays=None,
        busdaycal=None,
        out=None,
    )

    Calculates which of the given dates are valid days, and which are not.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dates : array_like of datetime64[D]
        The array of dates to process.
    weekmask : str or array_like of bool, optional
        A seven-element array indicating which of Monday through Sunday are
        valid days. May be specified as a length-seven list or array, like
        [1,1,1,1,1,0,0]; a length-seven string, like '1111100'; or a string
        like "Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri", made up of 3-character abbreviations for
        weekdays, optionally separated by white space. Valid abbreviations
        are: Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun
    holidays : array_like of datetime64[D], optional
        An array of dates to consider as invalid dates.  They may be
        specified in any order, and NaT (not-a-time) dates are ignored.
        This list is saved in a normalized form that is suited for
        fast calculations of valid days.
    busdaycal : busdaycalendar, optional
        A `busdaycalendar` object which specifies the valid days. If this
        parameter is provided, neither weekmask nor holidays may be
        provided.
    out : array of bool, optional
        If provided, this array is filled with the result.

    Returns
    -------
    out : array of bool
        An array with the same shape as ``dates``, containing True for
        each valid day, and False for each invalid day.

    See Also
    --------
    busdaycalendar : An object that specifies a custom set of valid days.
    busday_offset : Applies an offset counted in valid days.
    busday_count : Counts how many valid days are in a half-open date range.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> # The weekdays are Friday, Saturday, and Monday
    ... np.is_busday(['2011-07-01', '2011-07-02', '2011-07-18'],
    ...                 holidays=['2011-07-01', '2011-07-04', '2011-07-17'])
    array([False, False,  True])
