    """Horizontally partition the given list of nodes into a list of list of nodes where each sublist
    represents a partition. Nodes in different partitions are implemented in different combo kernels.
    Nodes in the same partition are likely to be implemented
    in the same combo kernel, but subject to subsequent restrictions like CUDA limits for number of args.

    Input arguments:
        nodes: a list of fused scheduler nodes to partition.
        triton_scheduling: TritonScheduling instance.
        node_info_map: a map from node to NodeInfo NamedTuple
    Output:
        a list of list of nodes with each sublist representing a partition.

    The default algorithm is to partition nodes based on the following rules:
        1) nodes with the same number of block dimensions are grouped together.
        2) large pointwise nodes (numels greater than LARGE_NUMELS) are separated from other nodes.
        3) large reduce nodes are separated from other nodes.
