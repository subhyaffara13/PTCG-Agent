def all_gather_object(object_list, obj, group=None):
    """
    Gathers picklable objects from the whole group into a list.

    Similar to :func:`all_gather`, but Python objects can be passed in.
    Note that the object must be picklable in order to be gathered.

    Args:
        object_list (list[Any]): Output list. It should be correctly sized as the
            size of the group for this collective and will contain the output.
        obj (Any): Pickable Python object to be broadcast from current process.
        group (ProcessGroup, optional): The process group to work on. If None,
            the default process group will be used. Default is ``None``.

    Returns:
        None. If the calling rank is part of this group, the output of the
        collective will be populated into the input ``object_list``. If the
        calling rank is not part of the group, the passed in ``object_list`` will
        be unmodified.

    .. note:: Note that this API differs slightly from the :func:`all_gather`
        collective since it does not provide an ``async_op`` handle and thus
        will be a blocking call.

    .. note:: For NCCL-based processed groups, internal tensor representations
        of objects must be moved to the GPU device before communication takes
        place. In this case, the device used is given by
        ``torch.cuda.current_device()`` and it is the user's responsibility to
        ensure that this is set so that each rank has an individual GPU, via
        ``torch.cuda.set_device()``.

    .. warning::
        Object collectives have a number of serious performance and scalability
        limitations.  See :ref:`object_collectives` for details.

    .. warning::
        :func:`all_gather_object` uses ``pickle`` module implicitly, which is
        known to be insecure. It is possible to construct malicious pickle data
        which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling. Only call this
        function with data you trust.

    .. warning::
        Calling :func:`all_gather_object` with GPU tensors is not well supported
        and inefficient as it incurs GPU -> CPU transfer since tensors would be
        pickled. Please consider using :func:`all_gather` instead.

    Example::
        >>> # xdoctest: +SKIP("need process group init")
        >>> # Note: Process group initialization omitted on each rank.
        >>> import torch.distributed as dist
        >>> # Assumes world_size of 3.
        >>> gather_objects = ["foo", 12, {1: 2}] # any picklable object
        >>> output = [None for _ in gather_objects]
        >>> dist.all_gather_object(output, gather_objects[dist.get_rank()])
        >>> output
        ['foo', 12, {1: 2}]
