    Given a state_dict, this API gathers all the ShardedTensors or DTensors in
    the state_dict.


    Args:
        state_dict (Dict[str, Any]): the target sharded state_dict.
        pg (Optional[dist.ProcessGroup]): the process group that is used to
            gather ShardedTensor. Note that gathering a DTensor will use
            the DeviceMesh. So this argument will be ignored when gathering a
            DTensor.
        device: (Optional[torch.device]): the device that is used to
            perform allgather for ShardedTensor. Note that gathering a DTensor
            will use the DeviceMesh. So this argument will be ignored when
            gathering a DTensor.
        cpu_offload (bool): whether to offload the tensors to CPU memory. The
            default value is False.
        ranks_only: (Tuple[int, ...]): if this tuple is empty, all ranks will
            have the same state_dicts. Otherwise only ranks that in ``ranks_only``
            have the same state_dicts. Other ranks will get empty state_dicts.
        type_check: (bool): check if the instance data type is a supported type
            that can be saved by DCP.  The current supported data types are
            torch.Tensor, DTensor, int, float, str, list, dict, None.

    Returns:
        The gathered state dictionary.
