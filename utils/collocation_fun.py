def collocation_fun(fun, y, p, x, h):
    """Evaluate collocation residuals.

    This function lies in the core of the method. The solution is sought
    as a cubic C1 continuous spline with derivatives matching the ODE rhs
    at given nodes `x`. Collocation conditions are formed from the equality
    of the spline derivatives and rhs of the ODE system in the middle points
    between nodes.

    Such method is classified to Lobbato IIIA family in ODE literature.
    Refer to [1]_ for the formula and some discussion.

    Returns
    -------
    col_res : ndarray, shape (n, m - 1)
        Collocation residuals at the middle points of the mesh intervals.
    y_middle : ndarray, shape (n, m - 1)
        Values of the cubic spline evaluated at the middle points of the mesh
        intervals.
    f : ndarray, shape (n, m)
        RHS of the ODE system evaluated at the mesh nodes.
    f_middle : ndarray, shape (n, m - 1)
        RHS of the ODE system evaluated at the middle points of the mesh
        intervals (and using `y_middle`).
