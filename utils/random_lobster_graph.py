def random_lobster_graph(n, p1, p2, seed=None, *, create_using=None):
    """Returns a random lobster graph.

    A lobster is a tree that reduces to a caterpillar when pruning all
    leaf nodes. A caterpillar is a tree that reduces to a path graph
    when pruning all leaf nodes; setting `p2` to zero produces a caterpillar.

    This implementation iterates on the probabilities `p1` and `p2` to add
    edges at levels 1 and 2, respectively. Graphs are therefore constructed
    iteratively with uniform randomness at each level rather than being selected
    uniformly at random from the set of all possible lobsters.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : int
        The expected number of nodes in the backbone
    p1 : float
        Probability of adding an edge to the backbone
    p2 : float
        Probability of adding an edge one level beyond backbone
    seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
        Indicator of random number generation state.
        See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.
    create_using : Graph constructor, optional (default=nx.Graph)
        Graph type to create. If graph instance, then cleared before populated.
        Multigraph and directed types are not supported and raise a ``NetworkXError``.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        If `p1` or `p2` parameters are >= 1 because the while loops would never finish.

        raise nx.NetworkXError("Probability values for `p1` and `p2` must both be < 1.")
