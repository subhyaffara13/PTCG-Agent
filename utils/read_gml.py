def read_gml(path, label="label", destringizer=None):
    """Read graph in GML format from `path`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    path : file or string
        Filename or file handle to read.
        Filenames ending in .gz or .bz2 will be decompressed.

    label : string, optional
        If not None, the parsed nodes will be renamed according to node
        attributes indicated by `label`. Default value: 'label'.

    destringizer : callable, optional
        A `destringizer` that recovers values stored as strings in GML. If it
        cannot convert a string to a value, a `ValueError` is raised. Default
        value : None.

    Returns
    -------
    G : NetworkX graph
        The parsed graph.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        If the input cannot be parsed.

    See Also
    --------
    write_gml, parse_gml
    literal_destringizer

    Notes
    -----
    GML files are stored using a 7-bit ASCII encoding with any extended
    ASCII characters (iso8859-1) appearing as HTML character entities.
    Without specifying a `stringizer`/`destringizer`, the code is capable of
    writing `int`/`float`/`str`/`dict`/`list` data as required by the GML
    specification.  For writing other data types, and for reading data other
    than `str` you need to explicitly supply a `stringizer`/`destringizer`.

    For additional documentation on the GML file format, please see the
    `GML url <https://web.archive.org/web/20190207140002/http://www.fim.uni-passau.de/index.php?id=17297&L=1>`_.

    See the module docstring :mod:`networkx.readwrite.gml` for more details.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.path_graph(4)
    >>> nx.write_gml(G, "test_path4.gml")

    GML values are interpreted as strings by default:

    >>> H = nx.read_gml("test_path4.gml")
    >>> H.nodes
    NodeView(('0', '1', '2', '3'))

    When a `destringizer` is provided, GML values are converted to the provided type.
    For example, integer nodes can be recovered as shown below:

    >>> J = nx.read_gml("test_path4.gml", destringizer=int)
    >>> J.nodes
    NodeView((0, 1, 2, 3))
