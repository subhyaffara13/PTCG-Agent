    """
    Loads the image processor configuration from a pretrained model image processor configuration.

    Args:
        pretrained_model_name_or_path (`str` or `os.PathLike`):
            This can be either:

            - a string, the *model id* of a pretrained model configuration hosted inside a model repo on
              huggingface.co.
            - a path to a *directory* containing a configuration file saved using the
              [`~ProcessorMixin.save_pretrained`] method, e.g., `./my_model_directory/`.

        cache_dir (`str` or `os.PathLike`, *optional*):
            Path to a directory in which a downloaded pretrained model configuration should be cached if the standard
            cache should not be used.
        force_download (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            Whether or not to force to (re-)download the configuration files and override the cached versions if they
            exist.
        proxies (`dict[str, str]`, *optional*):
            A dictionary of proxy servers to use by protocol or endpoint, e.g., `{'http': 'foo.bar:3128',
            'http://hostname': 'foo.bar:4012'}.` The proxies are used on each request.
        token (`str` or *bool*, *optional*):
            The token to use as HTTP bearer authorization for remote files. If `True`, will use the token generated
            when running `hf auth login` (stored in `~/.huggingface`).
        revision (`str`, *optional*, defaults to `"main"`):
            The specific model version to use. It can be a branch name, a tag name, or a commit id, since we use a
            git-based system for storing models and other artifacts on huggingface.co, so `revision` can be any
            identifier allowed by git.
        local_files_only (`bool`, *optional*, defaults to `False`):
            If `True`, will only try to load the image processor configuration from local files.

    <Tip>

    Passing `token=True` is required when you want to use a private model.

    </Tip>

    Returns:
        `Dict`: The configuration of the image processor.

    Examples:

    ```python
    # Download configuration from huggingface.co and cache.
    image_processor_config = get_image_processor_config("google-bert/bert-base-uncased")
    # This model does not have a image processor config so the result will be an empty dict.
    image_processor_config = get_image_processor_config("FacebookAI/xlm-roberta-base")

    # Save a pretrained image processor locally and you can reload its config
    from transformers import AutoImageProcessor

    image_processor = AutoImageProcessor.from_pretrained("google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k")
    image_processor.save_pretrained("image-processor-test")
    image_processor_config = get_image_processor_config("image-processor-test")
