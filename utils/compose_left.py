def compose_left(*funcs):
    """ Compose functions to operate in series.

    Returns a function that applies other functions in sequence.

    Functions are applied from left to right so that
    ``compose_left(f, g, h)(x, y)`` is the same as ``h(g(f(x, y)))``.

    If no arguments are provided, the identity function (f(x) = x) is returned.

    >>> inc = lambda i: i + 1
    >>> compose_left(inc, str)(3)
