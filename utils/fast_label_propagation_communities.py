def fast_label_propagation_communities(G, *, weight=None, seed=None):
    """Returns communities in `G` as detected by fast label propagation.

    The fast label propagation algorithm is described in [1]_. The algorithm is
    probabilistic and the found communities may vary in different executions.

    The algorithm operates as follows. First, the community label of each node is
    set to a unique label. The algorithm then repeatedly updates the labels of
    the nodes to the most frequent label in their neighborhood. In case of ties,
    a random label is chosen from the most frequent labels.

    The algorithm maintains a queue of nodes that still need to be processed.
    Initially, all nodes are added to the queue in a random order. Then the nodes
    are removed from the queue one by one and processed. If a node updates its label,
    all its neighbors that have a different label are added to the queue (if not
    already in the queue). The algorithm stops when the queue is empty.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : Graph, DiGraph, MultiGraph, or MultiDiGraph
        Any NetworkX graph.

    weight : string, or None (default)
        The edge attribute representing a non-negative weight of an edge. If None,
        each edge is assumed to have weight one. The weight of an edge is used in
        determining the frequency with which a label appears among the neighbors of
        a node (edge with weight `w` is equivalent to `w` unweighted edges).

    seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
        Indicator of random number generation state. See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.

    Returns
    -------
    communities : iterable
        Iterable of communities given as sets of nodes.

    Notes
    -----
    Edge directions are ignored for directed graphs.
    Edge weights must be non-negative numbers.
