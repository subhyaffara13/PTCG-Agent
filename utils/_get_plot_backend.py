def _get_plot_backend(backend: str | None = None):
    """
    Return the plotting backend to use (e.g. `pandas.plotting._matplotlib`).

    The plotting system of pandas uses matplotlib by default, but the idea here
    is that it can also work with other third-party backends. This function
    returns the module which provides a top-level `.plot` method that will
    actually do the plotting. The backend is specified from a string, which
    either comes from the keyword argument `backend`, or, if not specified, from
    the option `pandas.options.plotting.backend`. All the rest of the code in
    this file uses the backend specified there for the plotting.

    The backend is imported lazily, as matplotlib is a soft dependency, and
    pandas can be used without it being installed.

    Notes
    -----
    Modifies `_backends` with imported backend as a side effect.
