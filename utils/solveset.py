def solveset(f, symbol=None, domain=S.Complexes):
    r"""Solves a given inequality or equation with set as output

    Parameters
    ==========

    f : Expr or a relational.
        The target equation or inequality
    symbol : Symbol
        The variable for which the equation is solved
    domain : Set
        The domain over which the equation is solved

    Returns
    =======

    Set
        A set of values for `symbol` for which `f` is True or is equal to
        zero. An :class:`~.EmptySet` is returned if `f` is False or nonzero.
        A :class:`~.ConditionSet` is returned as unsolved object if algorithms
        to evaluate complete solution are not yet implemented.

    ``solveset`` claims to be complete in the solution set that it returns.

    Raises
    ======

    NotImplementedError
        The algorithms to solve inequalities in complex domain  are
        not yet implemented.
    ValueError
        The input is not valid.
    RuntimeError
        It is a bug, please report to the github issue tracker.


    Notes
    =====

    Python interprets 0 and 1 as False and True, respectively, but
    in this function they refer to solutions of an expression. So 0 and 1
    return the domain and EmptySet, respectively, while True and False
    return the opposite (as they are assumed to be solutions of relational
    expressions).

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import exp, sin, Symbol, pprint, S, Eq
    >>> from sympy.solvers.solveset import solveset, solveset_real

    * The default domain is complex. Not specifying a domain will lead
      to the solving of the equation in the complex domain (and this
      is not affected by the assumptions on the symbol):

    >>> x = Symbol('x')
    >>> pprint(solveset(exp(x) - 1, x), use_unicode=False)
    {2*n*I*pi | n in Integers}

    >>> x = Symbol('x', real=True)
    >>> pprint(solveset(exp(x) - 1, x), use_unicode=False)
    {2*n*I*pi | n in Integers}

    * If you want to use ``solveset`` to solve the equation in the
      real domain, provide a real domain. (Using ``solveset_real``
      does this automatically.)

    >>> R = S.Reals
    >>> x = Symbol('x')
    >>> solveset(exp(x) - 1, x, R)
    {0}
    >>> solveset_real(exp(x) - 1, x)
    {0}

    The solution is unaffected by assumptions on the symbol:

    >>> p = Symbol('p', positive=True)
    >>> pprint(solveset(p**2 - 4))
    {-2, 2}

    When a :class:`~.ConditionSet` is returned, symbols with assumptions that
    would alter the set are replaced with more generic symbols:

    >>> i = Symbol('i', imaginary=True)
    >>> solveset(Eq(i**2 + i*sin(i), 1), i, domain=S.Reals)
    ConditionSet(_R, Eq(_R**2 + _R*sin(_R) - 1, 0), Reals)

    * Inequalities can be solved over the real domain only. Use of a complex
      domain leads to a NotImplementedError.

    >>> solveset(exp(x) > 1, x, R)
