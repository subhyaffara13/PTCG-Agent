    """Add annotation fields to kernel events matching the annotations dict.

    Each annotation entry is a list (from nested ``mark_kernels`` scopes).
    Fields from all annotations are merged into the event args; if multiple
    annotations define the same key, later entries in the list win.

    For graphed events (graph_node_id != 0), reassigns ``tid`` and
    ``args["stream"]`` to the stream recorded in annotations, or to
    *default_stream* if there is no annotation.  Also moves the
    corresponding ``ac2g`` flow-finish events to the new tid so that
    CPU-to-GPU correlation arrows are preserved.

    Removes ``gpu_user_annotation`` events and orphaned ``ac2g`` events
    from streams that have no kernel or memcpy events after reassignment,
    since CUPTI replicates these onto every stream during graph replay.

    Returns the number of events annotated.
