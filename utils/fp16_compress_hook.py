    Compress by casting ``GradBucket`` to ``torch.float16`` divided by process group size.

    This DDP communication hook implements a simple gradient compression
    approach that casts ``GradBucket`` tensor to half-precision floating-point format (``torch.float16``)
    and then divides it by the process group size.
    It allreduces those ``float16`` gradient tensors. Once compressed gradient
    tensors are allreduced, the chained callback ``decompress`` casts it back to the input data type (such as ``float32``).

        >>> ddp_model.register_comm_hook(process_group, fp16_compress_hook)

    r"""
    Implement FSDP communication hook for a simple gradient compression approach.
    Casts ``grad`` to half-precision floating-point format (``torch.float16``).

    It also averages gradients by ``world_size`` in two steps: first it pre-divides gradients by a
    ``state.gradient_predivide_factor``, and after a communication step (``all_reduce`` or ``reduce_scatter``)
    gradients are averaged by a ``state.gradient_postdivide_factor``.
    Once post-division is done, compressed gradients are casted back to parameters' precision.

    Args:
        state (LowPrecisionState): State information, configures pre- and post-division factors, parameters' precision.
        grad (torch.Tensor): A gradient for the local batch that needs to be communicated across ranks in a lower precision.
        output (torch.Tensor): Stores a single shard of the gradient after ``reduce_scatter``.
