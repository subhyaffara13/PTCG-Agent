def nP(n, k=None, replacement=False):
    """Return the number of permutations of ``n`` items taken ``k`` at a time.

    Possible values for ``n``:

        integer - set of length ``n``

        sequence - converted to a multiset internally

        multiset - {element: multiplicity}

    If ``k`` is None then the total of all permutations of length 0
    through the number of items represented by ``n`` will be returned.

    If ``replacement`` is True then a given item can appear more than once
    in the ``k`` items. (For example, for 'ab' permutations of 2 would
    include 'aa', 'ab', 'ba' and 'bb'.) The multiplicity of elements in
    ``n`` is ignored when ``replacement`` is True but the total number
    of elements is considered since no element can appear more times than
    the number of elements in ``n``.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.functions.combinatorial.numbers import nP
    >>> from sympy.utilities.iterables import multiset_permutations, multiset
    >>> nP(3, 2)
    6
    >>> nP('abc', 2) == nP(multiset('abc'), 2) == 6
    True
    >>> nP('aab', 2)
    3
    >>> nP([1, 2, 2], 2)
    3
    >>> [nP(3, i) for i in range(4)]
    [1, 3, 6, 6]
    >>> nP(3) == sum(_)
    True

    When ``replacement`` is True, each item can have multiplicity
    equal to the length represented by ``n``:

    >>> nP('aabc', replacement=True)
    121
    >>> [len(list(multiset_permutations('aaaabbbbcccc', i))) for i in range(5)]
    [1, 3, 9, 27, 81]
    >>> sum(_)
    121
