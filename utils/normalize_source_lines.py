    This helper function accepts a list of source lines. It finds the
    indentation level of the function definition (`def`), then it indents
    all lines in the function body to a point at or greater than that
    level. This allows for comments and continued string literals that
    are at a lower indentation than the rest of the code.
    Args:
        sourcelines: function source code, separated into lines by
                        the '\n' character
    Returns:
        A list of source lines that have been correctly aligned
