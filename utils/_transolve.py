def _transolve(f, symbol, domain):
    r"""
    Function to solve transcendental equations. It is a helper to
    ``solveset`` and should be used internally. ``_transolve``
    currently supports the following class of equations:

        - Exponential equations
        - Logarithmic equations

    Parameters
    ==========

    f : Any transcendental equation that needs to be solved.
        This needs to be an expression, which is assumed
        to be equal to ``0``.

    symbol : The variable for which the equation is solved.
        This needs to be of class ``Symbol``.

    domain : A set over which the equation is solved.
        This needs to be of class ``Set``.

    Returns
    =======

    Set
        A set of values for ``symbol`` for which ``f`` is equal to
        zero. An ``EmptySet`` is returned if ``f`` does not have solutions
        in respective domain. A ``ConditionSet`` is returned as unsolved
        object if algorithms to evaluate complete solution are not
        yet implemented.

    How to use ``_transolve``
    =========================

    ``_transolve`` should not be used as an independent function, because
    it assumes that the equation (``f``) and the ``symbol`` comes from
    ``solveset`` and might have undergone a few modification(s).
    To use ``_transolve`` as an independent function the equation (``f``)
    and the ``symbol`` should be passed as they would have been by
    ``solveset``.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.solvers.solveset import _transolve as transolve
    >>> from sympy.solvers.solvers import _tsolve as tsolve
    >>> from sympy import symbols, S, pprint
    >>> x = symbols('x', real=True) # assumption added
    >>> transolve(5**(x - 3) - 3**(2*x + 1), x, S.Reals)
    {-(log(3) + 3*log(5))/(-log(5) + 2*log(3))}

    How ``_transolve`` works
    ========================

    ``_transolve`` uses two types of helper functions to solve equations
    of a particular class:

    Identifying helpers: To determine whether a given equation
    belongs to a certain class of equation or not. Returns either
    ``True`` or ``False``.

    Solving helpers: Once an equation is identified, a corresponding
    helper either solves the equation or returns a form of the equation
    that ``solveset`` might better be able to handle.

    * Philosophy behind the module

    The purpose of ``_transolve`` is to take equations which are not
    already polynomial in their generator(s) and to either recast them
    as such through a valid transformation or to solve them outright.
    A pair of helper functions for each class of supported
    transcendental functions are employed for this purpose. One
    identifies the transcendental form of an equation and the other
    either solves it or recasts it into a tractable form that can be
    solved by  ``solveset``.
    For example, an equation in the form `ab^{f(x)} - cd^{g(x)} = 0`
    can be transformed to
    `\log(a) + f(x)\log(b) - \log(c) - g(x)\log(d) = 0`
    (under certain assumptions) and this can be solved with ``solveset``
    if `f(x)` and `g(x)` are in polynomial form.

    How ``_transolve`` is better than ``_tsolve``
    =============================================

    1) Better output

    ``_transolve`` provides expressions in a more simplified form.

    Consider a simple exponential equation

    >>> f = 3**(2*x) - 2**(x + 3)
    >>> pprint(transolve(f, x, S.Reals), use_unicode=False)
        -3*log(2)
    {------------------}
     -2*log(3) + log(2)
    >>> pprint(tsolve(f, x), use_unicode=False)
         /   3     \
         | --------|
         | log(2/9)|
    [-log\2         /]

    2) Extensible

    The API of ``_transolve`` is designed such that it is easily
    extensible, i.e. the code that solves a given class of
    equations is encapsulated in a helper and not mixed in with
    the code of ``_transolve`` itself.

    3) Modular

    ``_transolve`` is designed to be modular i.e, for every class of
    equation a separate helper for identification and solving is
    implemented. This makes it easy to change or modify any of the
    method implemented directly in the helpers without interfering
    with the actual structure of the API.

    4) Faster Computation

    Solving equation via ``_transolve`` is much faster as compared to
    ``_tsolve``. In ``solve``, attempts are made computing every possibility
    to get the solutions. This series of attempts makes solving a bit
    slow. In ``_transolve``, computation begins only after a particular
    type of equation is identified.

    How to add new class of equations
    =================================

    Adding a new class of equation solver is a three-step procedure:

    - Identify the type of the equations

      Determine the type of the class of equations to which they belong:
      it could be of ``Add``, ``Pow``, etc. types. Separate internal functions
      are used for each type. Write identification and solving helpers
      and use them from within the routine for the given type of equation
      (after adding it, if necessary). Something like:

      .. code-block:: python

        def add_type(lhs, rhs, x):
            ....
            if _is_exponential(lhs, x):
                new_eq = _solve_exponential(lhs, rhs, x)
        ....
        rhs, lhs = eq.as_independent(x)
        if lhs.is_Add:
            result = add_type(lhs, rhs, x)

    - Define the identification helper.

    - Define the solving helper.

    Apart from this, a few other things needs to be taken care while
    adding an equation solver:

    - Naming conventions:
      Name of the identification helper should be as
      ``_is_class`` where class will be the name or abbreviation
      of the class of equation. The solving helper will be named as
      ``_solve_class``.
      For example: for exponential equations it becomes
      ``_is_exponential`` and ``_solve_expo``.
    - The identifying helpers should take two input parameters,
      the equation to be checked and the variable for which a solution
      is being sought, while solving helpers would require an additional
      domain parameter.
    - Be sure to consider corner cases.
    - Add tests for each helper.
    - Add a docstring to your helper that describes the method
      implemented.
      The documentation of the helpers should identify:

      - the purpose of the helper,
      - the method used to identify and solve the equation,
      - a proof of correctness
      - the return values of the helpers
