def gnc_graph(n, create_using=None, seed=None):
    """Returns the growing network with copying (GNC) digraph with `n` nodes.

    The GNC graph is built by adding nodes one at a time with a link to one
    previously added node (chosen uniformly at random) and to all of that
    node's successors.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : int
        The number of nodes for the generated graph.
    create_using : NetworkX graph constructor, optional (default DiGraph)
        Graph type to create. If graph instance, then cleared before populated.
    seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
        Indicator of random number generation state.
        See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.
