def gauss_chebyshev_t(n, n_digits):
    r"""
    Computes the Gauss-Chebyshev quadrature [1]_ points and weights of
    the first kind.

    Explanation
    ===========

    The Gauss-Chebyshev quadrature of the first kind approximates the integral:

    .. math::
        \int_{-1}^{1} \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}} f(x)\,dx \approx
            \sum_{i=1}^n w_i f(x_i)

    The nodes `x_i` of an order `n` quadrature rule are the roots of `T_n`
    and the weights `w_i` are given by:

    .. math::
        w_i = \frac{\pi}{n}

    Parameters
    ==========

    n :
        The order of quadrature.

    n_digits :
        Number of significant digits of the points and weights to return.

    Returns
    =======

    (x, w) : the ``x`` and ``w`` are lists of points and weights as Floats.
             The points `x_i` and weights `w_i` are returned as ``(x, w)``
             tuple of lists.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.integrals.quadrature import gauss_chebyshev_t
    >>> x, w = gauss_chebyshev_t(3, 5)
    >>> x
    [0.86602, 0, -0.86602]
    >>> w
    [1.0472, 1.0472, 1.0472]

    >>> x, w = gauss_chebyshev_t(6, 5)
    >>> x
    [0.96593, 0.70711, 0.25882, -0.25882, -0.70711, -0.96593]
    >>> w
    [0.5236, 0.5236, 0.5236, 0.5236, 0.5236, 0.5236]
