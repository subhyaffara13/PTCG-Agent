    """
    p, q are polynomials in Z[x] or Q[x]. It is assumed
    that degree(p, x) >= degree(q, x).

    Computes the (generalized) Sturm sequence of p and q in Z[x] or Q[x].
    If q = diff(p, x, 1) it is the usual Sturm sequence.

    A. If method == 0, default, the remainder coefficients of the
       sequence are (in absolute value) ``modified'' subresultants, which
       for non-monic polynomials are greater than the coefficients of the
       corresponding subresultants by the factor Abs(LC(p)**( deg(p)- deg(q))).

    B. If method == 1, the remainder coefficients of the sequence are (in
       absolute value) subresultants, which for non-monic polynomials are
       smaller than the coefficients of the corresponding ``modified''
       subresultants by the factor Abs( LC(p)**( deg(p)- deg(q)) ).

    If the Sturm sequence is complete, method=0 and LC( p ) > 0, then the
    coefficients of the polynomials in the sequence are ``modified'' subresultants.
    That is, they are  determinants of appropriately selected submatrices of
    sylvester2, Sylvester's matrix of 1853. In this case the Sturm sequence
    coincides with the ``modified'' subresultant prs, of the polynomials
    p, q.

    If the Sturm sequence is incomplete and method=0 then the signs of the
    coefficients of the polynomials in the sequence may differ from the signs
    of the coefficients of the corresponding polynomials in the ``modified''
    subresultant prs; however, the absolute values are the same.

    To compute the coefficients, no determinant evaluation takes place.
    Instead, we first compute the euclidean sequence  of p and q using
    euclid_amv(p, q, x) and then: (a) change the signs of the remainders in the
    Euclidean sequence according to the pattern "-, -, +, +, -, -, +, +,..."
    (see Lemma 1 in the 1st reference or Theorem 3 in the 2nd reference)
    and (b) if method=0, assuming deg(p) > deg(q), we multiply the remainder
    coefficients of the Euclidean sequence times the factor
    Abs( LC(p)**( deg(p)- deg(q)) ) to make them modified subresultants.
    See also the function sturm_pg(p, q, x).
