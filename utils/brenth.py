    """Find a root of a function in a bracketing interval using Brent's
    method with hyperbolic extrapolation.

    A variation on the classic Brent routine to find a root of the function f
    between the arguments a and b that uses hyperbolic extrapolation instead of
    inverse quadratic extrapolation. Bus & Dekker (1975) guarantee convergence
    for this method, claiming that the upper bound of function evaluations here
    is 4 or 5 times that of bisection.
    f(a) and f(b) cannot have the same signs. Generally, on a par with the
    brent routine, but not as heavily tested. It is a safe version of the
    secant method that uses hyperbolic extrapolation.
    The version here is by Chuck Harris, and implements Algorithm M of
    [BusAndDekker1975]_, where further details (convergence properties,
    additional remarks and such) can be found

    Parameters
    ----------
    f : function
        Python function returning a number. f must be continuous, and f(a) and
        f(b) must have opposite signs.
    a : scalar
        One end of the bracketing interval [a,b].
    b : scalar
        The other end of the bracketing interval [a,b].
    args : tuple, optional
        Containing extra arguments for the function `f`.
        `f` is called by ``apply(f, (x)+args)``.
    xtol : number, optional
        The computed root ``x0`` will satisfy ``np.isclose(x, x0,
        atol=xtol, rtol=rtol)``, where ``x`` is the exact root. The
        parameter must be positive. As with `brentq`, for nice
        functions the method will often satisfy the above condition
        with ``xtol/2`` and ``rtol/2``.
    rtol : number, optional
        The computed root ``x0`` will satisfy ``np.isclose(x, x0,
        atol=xtol, rtol=rtol)``, where ``x`` is the exact root. The
        parameter cannot be smaller than its default value of
        ``4*np.finfo(float).eps``. As with `brentq`, for nice functions
        the method will often satisfy the above condition with
        ``xtol/2`` and ``rtol/2``.
    maxiter : int, optional
        If convergence is not achieved in `maxiter` iterations, an error is
        raised. Must be >= 0.
    full_output : bool, optional
        If `full_output` is False, the root is returned. If `full_output` is
        True, the return value is ``(x, r)``, where `x` is the root, and `r` is
        a `RootResults` object.
    disp : bool, optional
        If True, raise RuntimeError if the algorithm didn't converge.
        Otherwise, the convergence status is recorded in any `RootResults`
        return object.

    Returns
    -------
    root : float
        Root of `f` between `a` and `b`.
    r : `RootResults` (present if ``full_output = True``)
        Object containing information about the convergence. In particular,
        ``r.converged`` is True if the routine converged.

    Notes
    -----
    As mentioned in the parameter documentation, the computed root ``x0`` will
    satisfy ``np.isclose(x, x0, atol=xtol, rtol=rtol)``, where ``x`` is the
    exact root. In equation form, this terminating condition is ``abs(x - x0)
    <= xtol + rtol * abs(x0)``.

    The default value ``xtol=2e-12`` may lead to surprising behavior if one
    expects `brenth` to always compute roots with relative error near machine
    precision. Care should be taken to select `xtol` for the use case at hand.
    Setting ``xtol=5e-324``, the smallest subnormal number, will ensure the
    highest level of accuracy. Larger values of `xtol` may be useful for saving
    function evaluations when a root is at or near zero in applications where
    the tiny absolute differences available between floating point numbers near
    zero are not meaningful.
