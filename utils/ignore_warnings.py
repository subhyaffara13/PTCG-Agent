def ignore_warnings(warningcls):
    '''
    Context manager to suppress warnings during tests.

    .. note::

       Do not use this with SymPyDeprecationWarning in the tests.
       warns_deprecated_sympy() should be used instead.

    This function is useful for suppressing warnings during tests. The warns
    function should be used to assert that a warning is raised. The
    ignore_warnings function is useful in situation when the warning is not
    guaranteed to be raised (e.g. on importing a module) or if the warning
    comes from third-party code.

    This function is also useful to prevent the same or similar warnings from
    being issue twice due to recursive calls.

    When the warning is coming (reliably) from SymPy the warns function should
    be preferred to ignore_warnings.

    >>> from sympy.utilities.exceptions import ignore_warnings
    >>> import warnings

    Here's a warning:

    >>> with warnings.catch_warnings():  # reset warnings in doctest
    ...     warnings.simplefilter('error')
    ...     warnings.warn('deprecated', UserWarning)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
    UserWarning: deprecated

    Let's suppress it with ignore_warnings:

    >>> with warnings.catch_warnings():  # reset warnings in doctest
    ...     warnings.simplefilter('error')
    ...     with ignore_warnings(UserWarning):
    ...         warnings.warn('deprecated', UserWarning)

    (No warning emitted)
