    """Bracket the minimum of a unimodal scalar function of one variable

    This function works elementwise when `xm0`, `xl0`, `xr0`, `xmin`, `xmax`,
    and the elements of `args` are broadcastable arrays.

    Parameters
    ----------
    func : callable
        The function for which the minimum is to be bracketed.
        The signature must be::

            func(x: ndarray, *args) -> ndarray

        where each element of ``x`` is a finite real and ``args`` is a tuple,
        which may contain an arbitrary number of arrays that are broadcastable
        with ``x``. `func` must be an elementwise function: each element
        ``func(x)[i]`` must equal ``func(x[i])`` for all indices `i`.
    xm0: float array_like
        Starting guess for middle point of bracket.
    xl0, xr0: float array_like, optional
        Starting guesses for left and right endpoints of the bracket. Must be
        broadcastable with one another and with `xm0`.
    xmin, xmax : float array_like, optional
        Minimum and maximum allowable endpoints of the bracket, inclusive. Must
        be broadcastable with `xl0`, `xm0`, and `xr0`.
    factor : float array_like, optional
        Controls expansion of bracket endpoint in downhill direction. Works
        differently in the cases where a limit is set in the downhill direction
        with `xmax` or `xmin`. See Notes.
    args : tuple, optional
        Additional positional arguments to be passed to `func`.  Must be arrays
        broadcastable with `xl0`, `xm0`, `xr0`, `xmin`, and `xmax`. If the
        callable to be bracketed requires arguments that are not broadcastable
        with these arrays, wrap that callable with `func` such that `func`
        accepts only ``x`` and broadcastable arrays.
    kwargs : dict of str:array_like, optional
        Additional keyword arguments to be passed to `f`. See `args`.
    maxiter : int, optional
        The maximum number of iterations of the algorithm to perform. The number
        of function evaluations is three greater than the number of iterations.

    Returns
    -------
    res : _RichResult
        An instance of `scipy._lib._util._RichResult` with the following
        attributes. The descriptions are written as though the values will be
        scalars; however, if `func` returns an array, the outputs will be
        arrays of the same shape.

        xl, xm, xr : float
            The left, middle, and right points of the bracket, if the algorithm
            terminated successfully.
        fl, fm, fr : float
            The function value at the left, middle, and right points of the bracket.
        nfev : int
            The number of function evaluations required to find the bracket.
        nit : int
            The number of iterations of the algorithm that were performed.
        status : int
            An integer representing the exit status of the algorithm.

            - ``0`` : The algorithm produced a valid bracket.
            - ``-1`` : The bracket expanded to the allowable limits. Assuming
                       unimodality, this implies the endpoint at the limit is a
                       minimizer.
            - ``-2`` : The maximum number of iterations was reached.
            - ``-3`` : A non-finite value was encountered.
            - ``-4`` : ``None`` shall pass.
            - ``-5`` : The initial bracket does not satisfy
                       `xmin <= xl0 < xm0 < xr0 <= xmax`.

        success : bool
            ``True`` when the algorithm terminated successfully (status ``0``).

    Notes
    -----
    Similar to `scipy.optimize.bracket`, this function seeks to find real
    points ``xl < xm < xr`` such that ``f(xl) >= f(xm)`` and ``f(xr) >= f(xm)``,
    where at least one of the inequalities is strict. Unlike `scipy.optimize.bracket`,
    this function can operate in a vectorized manner on array input, so long as
    the input arrays are broadcastable with each other. Also unlike
    `scipy.optimize.bracket`, users may specify minimum and maximum endpoints
    for the desired bracket.

    Given an initial trio of points ``xl = xl0``, ``xm = xm0``, ``xr = xr0``,
    the algorithm checks if these points already give a valid bracket. If not,
    a new endpoint, ``w`` is chosen in the "downhill" direction, ``xm`` becomes the new
    opposite endpoint, and either `xl` or `xr` becomes the new middle point,
    depending on which direction is downhill. The algorithm repeats from here.

    The new endpoint `w` is chosen differently depending on whether or not a
    boundary `xmin` or `xmax` has been set in the downhill direction. Without
    loss of generality, suppose the downhill direction is to the right, so that
    ``f(xl) > f(xm) > f(xr)``. If there is no boundary to the right, then `w`
    is chosen to be ``xr + factor * (xr - xm)`` where `factor` is controlled by
    the user (defaults to 2.0) so that step sizes increase in geometric proportion.
    If there is a boundary, `xmax` in this case, then `w` is chosen to be
    ``xmax - (xmax - xr)/factor``, with steps slowing to a stop at
    `xmax`. This cautious approach ensures that a minimum near but distinct from
    the boundary isn't missed while also detecting whether or not the `xmax` is
    a minimizer when `xmax` is reached after a finite number of steps.
