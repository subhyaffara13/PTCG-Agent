def global_efficiency(G):
    """Returns the average global efficiency of the graph.

    The *efficiency* of a pair of nodes in a graph is the multiplicative
    inverse of the shortest path distance between the nodes. The *average
    global efficiency* of a graph is the average efficiency of all pairs of
    nodes [1]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : :class:`networkx.Graph`
        An undirected graph for which to compute the average global efficiency.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        The average global efficiency of the graph.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.Graph([(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3)])
    >>> round(nx.global_efficiency(G), 12)
    0.916666666667

    Notes
    -----
    Edge weights are ignored when computing the shortest path distances.
