def copyto(dst, src, casting="same_kind", where=True):
    """
    copyto(dst, src, casting='same_kind', where=True)

    Copies values from one array to another, broadcasting as necessary.

    Raises a TypeError if the `casting` rule is violated, and if
    `where` is provided, it selects which elements to copy.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dst : ndarray
        The array into which values are copied.
    src : array_like
        The array from which values are copied.
    casting : {'no', 'equiv', 'safe', 'same_kind', 'unsafe'}, optional
        Controls what kind of data casting may occur when copying.

        * 'no' means the data types should not be cast at all.
        * 'equiv' means only byte-order changes are allowed.
        * 'safe' means only casts which can preserve values are allowed.
        * 'same_kind' means only safe casts or casts within a kind,
          like float64 to float32, are allowed.
        * 'unsafe' means any data conversions may be done.
    where : array_like of bool, optional
        A boolean array which is broadcasted to match the dimensions
        of `dst`, and selects elements to copy from `src` to `dst`
        wherever it contains the value True.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> A = np.array([4, 5, 6])
    >>> B = [1, 2, 3]
    >>> np.copyto(A, B)
    >>> A
    array([1, 2, 3])

    >>> A = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
    >>> B = [[4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
    >>> np.copyto(A, B)
    >>> A
    array([[4, 5, 6],
           [7, 8, 9]])
