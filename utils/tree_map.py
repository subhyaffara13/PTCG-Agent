    Args:
        func (callable): A function that takes ``1 + len(rests)`` arguments, to be applied at the
            corresponding leaves of the pytrees.
        tree (pytree): A pytree to be mapped over, with each leaf providing the first positional
            argument to function ``func``.
        rests (tuple of pytree): A tuple of pytrees, each of which has the same structure as
            ``tree`` or has ``tree`` as a prefix.
        is_leaf (callable, optional): An extra leaf predicate function that will be called at each
            flattening step. The function should have a single argument with signature
            ``is_leaf(node) -> bool``. If it returns :data:`True`, the whole subtree being treated
            as a leaf. Otherwise, the default pytree registry will be used to determine a node is a
            leaf or not. If the function is not specified, the default pytree registry will be used.

    Returns:
        A new pytree with the same structure as ``tree`` but with the value at each leaf given by
        ``func(x, *xs)`` where ``x`` is the value at the corresponding leaf in ``tree`` and ``xs``
        is the tuple of values at corresponding nodes in ``rests``.
