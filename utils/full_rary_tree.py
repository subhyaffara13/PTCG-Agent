def full_rary_tree(r, n, create_using=None):
    """Creates a full r-ary tree of `n` nodes.

    Sometimes called a k-ary, n-ary, or m-ary tree.
    "... all non-leaf nodes have exactly r children and all levels
    are full except for some rightmost position of the bottom level
    (if a leaf at the bottom level is missing, then so are all of the
    leaves to its right." [1]_

    .. plot::

        >>> nx.draw(nx.full_rary_tree(2, 10))

    Parameters
    ----------
    r : int
        branching factor of the tree
    n : int
        Number of nodes in the tree
    create_using : NetworkX graph constructor, optional (default=nx.Graph)
       Graph type to create. If graph instance, then cleared before populated.

    Returns
    -------
    G : networkx Graph
        An r-ary tree with n nodes
