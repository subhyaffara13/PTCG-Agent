    A triton-contiguous tensor is defined as a tensor that has strides
    with minimal value smaller than or equal to 1.

    While triton kernels support triton-non-contiguous tensors (all
    strides being greater than 1) arguments, a considerable slow-down
    occurs because tensor data is copied element-wise rather than
    chunk-wise. Zero strides is assumed to not have this defect.
