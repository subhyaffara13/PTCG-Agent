def singular_leading_submatrix(A, U, k):
    """
    Compute term that makes the leading ``k`` by ``k``
    submatrix from ``A`` singular.

    Parameters
    ----------
    A : ndarray
        Symmetric matrix that is not positive definite.
    U : ndarray
        Upper triangular matrix resulting of an incomplete
        Cholesky decomposition of matrix ``A``.
    k : int
        Positive integer such that the leading k by k submatrix from
        `A` is the first non-positive definite leading submatrix.

    Returns
    -------
    delta : float
        Amount that should be added to the element (k, k) of the
        leading k by k submatrix of ``A`` to make it singular.
    v : ndarray
        A vector such that ``v.T B v = 0``. Where B is the matrix A after
        ``delta`` is added to its element (k, k).
