def tree_all_pairs_lowest_common_ancestor(G, root=None, pairs=None):
    r"""Yield the lowest common ancestor for sets of pairs in a tree.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX directed graph (must be a tree)

    root : node, optional (default: None)
        The root of the subtree to operate on.
        If None, assume the entire graph has exactly one source and use that.

    pairs : iterable or iterator of pairs of nodes, optional (default: None)
        The pairs of interest. If None, Defaults to all pairs of nodes
        under `root` that have a lowest common ancestor.

    Returns
    -------
    lcas : generator of tuples `((u, v), lca)` where `u` and `v` are nodes
        in `pairs` and `lca` is their lowest common ancestor.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import pprint
    >>> G = nx.DiGraph([(1, 3), (2, 4), (1, 2)])
    >>> pprint.pprint(dict(nx.tree_all_pairs_lowest_common_ancestor(G)))
    {(1, 1): 1,
     (2, 1): 1,
     (2, 2): 2,
     (3, 1): 1,
     (3, 2): 1,
     (3, 3): 3,
     (3, 4): 1,
     (4, 1): 1,
     (4, 2): 2,
     (4, 4): 4}

    We can also use `pairs` argument to specify the pairs of nodes for which we
    want to compute lowest common ancestors. Here is an example:

    >>> dict(nx.tree_all_pairs_lowest_common_ancestor(G, pairs=[(1, 4), (2, 3)]))
    {(2, 3): 1, (1, 4): 1}

    Notes
    -----
    Only defined on non-null trees represented with directed edges from
    parents to children. Uses Tarjan's off-line lowest-common-ancestors
    algorithm. Runs in time $O(4 \times (V + E + P))$ time, where 4 is the largest
    value of the inverse Ackermann function likely to ever come up in actual
    use, and $P$ is the number of pairs requested (or $V^2$ if all are needed).
