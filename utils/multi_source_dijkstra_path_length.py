def multi_source_dijkstra_path_length(G, sources, cutoff=None, weight="weight"):
    """Find shortest weighted path lengths in G from a given set of
    source nodes.

    Compute the shortest path length between any of the source nodes and
    all other reachable nodes for a weighted graph.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    sources : non-empty set of nodes
        Starting nodes for paths. If this is just a set containing a
        single node, then all paths computed by this function will start
        from that node. If there are two or more nodes in the set, the
        computed paths may begin from any one of the start nodes.

    cutoff : integer or float, optional
        Length (sum of edge weights) at which the search is stopped.
        If cutoff is provided, only return paths with summed weight <= cutoff.

    weight : string or function
        If this is a string, then edge weights will be accessed via the
        edge attribute with this key (that is, the weight of the edge
        joining `u` to `v` will be ``G.edges[u, v][weight]``). If no
        such edge attribute exists, the weight of the edge is assumed to
        be one.

        If this is a function, the weight of an edge is the value
        returned by the function. The function must accept exactly three
        positional arguments: the two endpoints of an edge and the
        dictionary of edge attributes for that edge. The function must
        return a number or None to indicate a hidden edge.

    Returns
    -------
    length : dict
        Dict keyed by node to shortest path length to nearest source.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.path_graph(5)
    >>> length = nx.multi_source_dijkstra_path_length(G, {0, 4})
    >>> for node in [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]:
    ...     print(f"{node}: {length[node]}")
    0: 0
    1: 1
    2: 2
    3: 1
    4: 0

    Notes
    -----
    Edge weight attributes must be numerical.
    Distances are calculated as sums of weighted edges traversed.

    The weight function can be used to hide edges by returning None.
    So ``weight = lambda u, v, d: 1 if d['color']=="red" else None``
    will find the shortest red path.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `sources` is empty.
    NodeNotFound
        If any of `sources` is not in `G`.
