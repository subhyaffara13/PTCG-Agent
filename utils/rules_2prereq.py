       Description by example
       ----------------------

       given set of logic rules:

         a -> b, c
         b -> c

       we build prerequisites (from what points something can be deduced):

         b <- a
         c <- a, b

       rules:   {} of a -> [b, c, ...]
       return:  {} of c <- [a, b, ...]

       Note however, that this prerequisites may be *not* enough to prove a
       fact. An example is 'a -> b' rule, where prereq(a) is b, and prereq(b)
       is a. That's because a=T -> b=T, and b=F -> a=F, but a=F -> b=?
