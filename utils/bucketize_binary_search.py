    See [Note: Inductor bucketize op]

    Inputs:
    -------
    values: the values to bucketize.
    boundaries_ptr: a pointer to the beginning of the boundaries tensor, in 1-D.
    BOUNDARIES_SIZE: the length of the last dimension of the boundaries tensor (i.e. one
    individual set of boundaries).
    BOUNDARIES_UNDERLYING_NUMEL: the length of the boundaries tensor, in 1-D, ignoring
    any striding.
    BOUNDARIES_STRIDE: the stride of the last dimension of the boundaries tensor
    boundary_indices: a tensor of the same size as "values"; each element is an index
    into a 1-D, un-strided boundaries tensor, pointing to the first element in the set
    of boundaries used for that value.
    indexing_dtype: the dtype used for indexing into the boundaries tensor, and the
    return dtype.
    right: if true, use boundary intervals closed on the left; otherwise use intervals
    closed on the right.
    sorter_ptr: an optional pointer to a sorter tensor of the same shape as boundaries,
    but potentially different striding.  If present, this allows us to treat boundaries
    as sorted even if the elements of boundaries are unsorted.
    SORTER_STRIDE: must be present if sorter_ptr is non-None; the stride of the last
    dimension of the sorter tensor.
    sorter_indices: must be present if sorter_ptr is non-None; see "boundary_indices".
    BLOCK_SHAPE: the shape of the data block being processed.
