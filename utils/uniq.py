    Yield unique elements from ``seq`` as an iterator. The second
    parameter ``result``  is used internally; it is not necessary
    to pass anything for this.

    Note: changing the sequence during iteration will raise a
    RuntimeError if the size of the sequence is known; if you pass
    an iterator and advance the iterator you will change the
    output of this routine but there will be no warning.
