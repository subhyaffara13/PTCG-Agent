def energy_distance(u_values, v_values, u_weights=None, v_weights=None):
    r"""Compute the energy distance between two 1D distributions.

    .. versionadded:: 1.0.0

    Parameters
    ----------
    u_values, v_values : array_like
        Values observed in the (empirical) distribution.
    u_weights, v_weights : array_like, optional
        Weight for each value. If unspecified, each value is assigned the same
        weight.
        `u_weights` (resp. `v_weights`) must have the same length as
        `u_values` (resp. `v_values`). If the weight sum differs from 1, it
        must still be positive and finite so that the weights can be normalized
        to sum to 1.

    Returns
    -------
    distance : float
        The computed distance between the distributions.

    Notes
    -----
    The energy distance between two distributions :math:`u` and :math:`v`, whose
    respective CDFs are :math:`U` and :math:`V`, equals to:

    .. math::

        D(u, v) = \left( 2\mathbb E|X - Y| - \mathbb E|X - X'| -
        \mathbb E|Y - Y'| \right)^{1/2}

    where :math:`X` and :math:`X'` (resp. :math:`Y` and :math:`Y'`) are
    independent random variables whose probability distribution is :math:`u`
    (resp. :math:`v`).

    Sometimes the square of this quantity is referred to as the "energy
    distance" (e.g. in [2]_, [4]_), but as noted in [1]_ and [3]_, only the
    definition above satisfies the axioms of a distance function (metric).

    As shown in [2]_, for one-dimensional real-valued variables, the energy
    distance is linked to the non-distribution-free version of the Cramér-von
    Mises distance:

    .. math::

        D(u, v) = \sqrt{2} l_2(u, v) = \left( 2 \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} (U-V)^2
        \right)^{1/2}

    Note that the common Cramér-von Mises criterion uses the distribution-free
    version of the distance. See [2]_ (section 2), for more details about both
    versions of the distance.

    The input distributions can be empirical, therefore coming from samples
    whose values are effectively inputs of the function, or they can be seen as
    generalized functions, in which case they are weighted sums of Dirac delta
    functions located at the specified values.
