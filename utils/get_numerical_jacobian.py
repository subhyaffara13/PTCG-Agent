    This is a Deprecated API.

    Args:
        fn: the function to compute the Jacobian for (must take inputs as a tuple)
        inputs: input to `fn`
        target: the Tensors wrt whom Jacobians are calculated (default=`input`)
        eps: the magnitude of the perturbation during finite differencing
             (default=`1e-3`)
        grad_out: defaults to 1.0.

    Returns:
        A list of Jacobians of `fn` (restricted to its first output) with respect to
        each input or target, if provided.

    Note that `target` may not even be part of `input` to `fn`, so please be
    **very careful** in this to not clone `target`.
