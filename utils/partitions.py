def partitions(n, m=None, k=None, size=False):
    """Generate all partitions of positive integer, n.

    Each partition is represented as a dictionary, mapping an integer
    to the number of copies of that integer in the partition.  For example,
    the first partition of 4 returned is {4: 1}, "4: one of them".

    Parameters
    ==========
    n : int
    m : int, optional
        limits number of parts in partition (mnemonic: m, maximum parts)
    k : int, optional
        limits the numbers that are kept in the partition (mnemonic: k, keys)
    size : bool, default: False
        If ``True``, (M, P) is returned where M is the sum of the
        multiplicities and P is the generated partition.
        If ``False``, only the generated partition is returned.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.utilities.iterables import partitions

    The numbers appearing in the partition (the key of the returned dict)
    are limited with k:

    >>> for p in partitions(6, k=2):  # doctest: +SKIP
    ...     print(p)
    {2: 3}
    {1: 2, 2: 2}
    {1: 4, 2: 1}
    {1: 6}

    The maximum number of parts in the partition (the sum of the values in
    the returned dict) are limited with m (default value, None, gives
    partitions from 1 through n):

    >>> for p in partitions(6, m=2):  # doctest: +SKIP
    ...     print(p)
    ...
    {6: 1}
    {1: 1, 5: 1}
    {2: 1, 4: 1}
    {3: 2}
