def chebgauss(deg):
    """
    Gauss-Chebyshev quadrature.

    Computes the sample points and weights for Gauss-Chebyshev quadrature.
    These sample points and weights will correctly integrate polynomials of
    degree :math:`2*deg - 1` or less over the interval :math:`[-1, 1]` with
    the weight function :math:`f(x) = 1/\\sqrt{1 - x^2}`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    deg : int
        Number of sample points and weights. It must be >= 1.

    Returns
    -------
    x : ndarray
        1-D ndarray containing the sample points.
    y : ndarray
        1-D ndarray containing the weights.

    Notes
    -----
    The results have only been tested up to degree 100, higher degrees may
    be problematic. For Gauss-Chebyshev there are closed form solutions for
    the sample points and weights. If n = `deg`, then

    .. math:: x_i = \\cos(\\pi (2 i - 1) / (2 n))

    .. math:: w_i = \\pi / n
