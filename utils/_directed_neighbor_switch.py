    G, w, unsat, h_node_residual_out, chords, h_partition_in, partition
):
    """Releases one free stub for node w, while preserving joint degree in G.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : networkx directed graph
        graph within which the edge swap will take place.
    w : integer
        node id for which we need to perform a neighbor switch.
    unsat: set of integers
        set of node ids that have the same degree as w and are unsaturated.
    h_node_residual_out: dict of integers
        for a given node, keeps track of the remaining stubs to be added.
    chords: set of tuples
        keeps track of available positions to add edges.
    h_partition_in: dict of integers
        for a given node, keeps track of its partition id (in degree).
    partition: integer
        partition id to check if chords have to be updated.

    Notes
    -----
    First, it selects node w_prime that (1) has the same degree as w and
    (2) is unsaturated. Then, it selects node v, a neighbor of w, that is
    not connected to w_prime and does an edge swap i.e. removes (w,v) and
    adds (w_prime,v). If neighbor switch is not possible for w using
    w_prime and v, then return w_prime; in [1] it's proven that
    such unsaturated nodes can be used.
