def _array_patch_perimeters(x, rstride, cstride):
    """
    Extract perimeters of patches from *arr*.

    Extracted patches are of size (*rstride* + 1) x (*cstride* + 1) and
    share perimeters with their neighbors. The ordering of the vertices matches
    that returned by ``_array_perimeter``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : ndarray, shape (N, M)
        Input array
    rstride : int
        Vertical (row) stride between corresponding elements of each patch
    cstride : int
        Horizontal (column) stride between corresponding elements of each patch

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray, shape (N/rstride * M/cstride, 2 * (rstride + cstride))

    #     cstride for top and bottom and rstride for left and right)

    # operation here is the np.concatenate.
