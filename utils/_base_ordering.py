def _base_ordering(base, degree):
    r"""
    Order `\{0, 1, \dots, n-1\}` so that base points come first and in order.

    Parameters
    ==========

    base : the base
    degree : the degree of the associated permutation group

    Returns
    =======

    A list ``base_ordering`` such that ``base_ordering[point]`` is the
    number of ``point`` in the ordering.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.combinatorics import SymmetricGroup
    >>> from sympy.combinatorics.util import _base_ordering
    >>> S = SymmetricGroup(4)
    >>> S.schreier_sims()
    >>> _base_ordering(S.base, S.degree)
    [0, 1, 2, 3]

    Notes
    =====

    This is used in backtrack searches, when we define a relation `\ll` on
    the underlying set for a permutation group of degree `n`,
    `\{0, 1, \dots, n-1\}`, so that if `(b_1, b_2, \dots, b_k)` is a base we
    have `b_i \ll b_j` whenever `i<j` and `b_i \ll a` for all
    `i\in\{1,2, \dots, k\}` and `a` is not in the base. The idea is developed
    and applied to backtracking algorithms in [1], pp.108-132. The points
    that are not in the base are taken in increasing order.
