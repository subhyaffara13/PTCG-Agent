    """
    Convert aspect ratio tuples to ids (numpy version).

    For batch padding we use 0, because there might be different number of images in each batch.
    The aspect ratio ids start from 1, with 1 corresponding to the first supported aspect ratio.

    Args:
        aspect_ratios (`List[List[Tuple[int, int]]]`):
            A list of aspect ratios for each image in the batch.
        max_image_tiles (`int`):
            The maximum number of tiles any image can be split into.

    Returns:
        `np.ndarray`:
            The aspect ratios ids as an array with shape (batch_size, max_num_images).
            Each id corresponds to the index of the aspect ratio in the list of supported aspect ratios,
            offset by 1 (so 0 can be used for padding).
