def hexagonal_lattice_graph(
    m, n, periodic=False, with_positions=True, create_using=None
):
    """Returns an `m` by `n` hexagonal lattice graph.

    The *hexagonal lattice graph* is a graph whose nodes and edges are
    the `hexagonal tiling`_ of the plane.

    The returned graph will have `m` rows and `n` columns of hexagons.
    `Odd numbered columns`_ are shifted up relative to even numbered columns.

    Positions of nodes are computed by default or `with_positions is True`.
    Node positions creating the standard embedding in the plane
    with sidelength 1 and are stored in the node attribute 'pos'.
    `pos = nx.get_node_attributes(G, 'pos')` creates a dict ready for drawing.

    Parameters
    ----------
    m : int
        The number of rows of hexagons in the lattice.

    n : int
        The number of columns of hexagons in the lattice.

    periodic : bool
        Whether to make a periodic grid by joining the boundary vertices.
        For this to work `n` must be even and both `n > 1` and `m > 1`.
        The periodic connections create another row and column of hexagons
        so these graphs have fewer nodes as boundary nodes are identified.

    with_positions : bool (default: True)
        Store the coordinates of each node in the graph node attribute 'pos'.
        The coordinates provide a lattice with vertical columns of hexagons
        offset to interleave and cover the plane.
        Periodic positions shift the nodes vertically in a nonlinear way so
        the edges don't overlap so much.

    create_using : NetworkX graph constructor, optional (default=nx.Graph)
        Graph type to create. If graph instance, then cleared before populated.
        If graph is directed, edges will point up or right.

    Returns
    -------
    NetworkX graph
        The *m* by *n* hexagonal lattice graph.
