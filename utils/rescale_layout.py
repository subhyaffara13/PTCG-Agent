def rescale_layout(pos, scale=1):
    """Returns scaled position array to (-scale, scale) in all axes.

    The function acts on NumPy arrays which hold position information.
    Each position is one row of the array. The dimension of the space
    equals the number of columns. Each coordinate in one column.

    To rescale, the mean (center) is subtracted from each axis separately.
    Then all values are scaled so that the largest magnitude value
    from all axes equals `scale` (thus, the aspect ratio is preserved).
    The resulting NumPy Array is returned (order of rows unchanged).

    Parameters
    ----------
    pos : numpy array
        positions to be scaled. Each row is a position.

    scale : number (default: 1)
        The size of the resulting extent in all directions.

    attribute : str, default None
        If non-None, the position of each node will be stored on the graph as
        an attribute named `attribute` which can be accessed with
        `G.nodes[...][attribute]`. The function still returns the dictionary.

    Returns
    -------
    pos : numpy array
        scaled positions. Each row is a position.
