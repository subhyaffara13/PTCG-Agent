def check_COLA(window, nperseg, noverlap, tol=1e-10):
    r"""Check whether the Constant OverLap Add (COLA) constraint is met
    (legacy function).

    .. legacy:: function

        The COLA constraint is equivalent of having a constant dual window, i.e.,
        ``all(ShortTimeFFT.dual_win == ShortTimeFFT.dual_win[0])``. Hence,
        `closest_STFT_dual_window` generalizes this function, as the following
        example shows:

        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> from scipy.signal import check_COLA, closest_STFT_dual_window, windows
        ...
        >>> w, w_rect, hop = windows.hann(12, sym=False), np.ones(12), 6
        >>> dual_win, alpha = closest_STFT_dual_window(w, hop, w_rect, scaled=True)
        >>> np.allclose(dual_win/alpha, w_rect, atol=1e-10, rtol=0)
        True
        >>> check_COLA(w, len(w), len(w) - hop)  # equivalent legacy function call
        True


    Parameters
    ----------
    window : str or tuple or array_like
        Desired window to use. If `window` is a string or tuple, it is
        passed to `get_window` to generate the window values, which are
        DFT-even by default. See `get_window` for a list of windows and
        required parameters. If `window` is array_like it will be used
        directly as the window and its length must be nperseg.
    nperseg : int
        Length of each segment.
    noverlap : int
        Number of points to overlap between segments.
    tol : float, optional
        The allowed variance of a bin's weighted sum from the median bin
        sum.

    Returns
    -------
    verdict : bool
        `True` if chosen combination satisfies COLA within `tol`,
        `False` otherwise

    See Also
    --------
    closest_STFT_dual_window: Allows determining the closest window meeting the
                              COLA constraint for a given window
    check_NOLA: Check whether the Nonzero Overlap Add (NOLA) constraint is met
    ShortTimeFFT: Provide short-time Fourier transform and its inverse
    stft: Short-time Fourier transform (legacy)
    istft: Inverse Short-time Fourier transform (legacy)

    Notes
    -----
    In order to invert a short-time Fourier transfrom (STFT) with the so-called
    "overlap-add method", the signal windowing must obey the constraint of
    "Constant OverLap Add" (COLA). This ensures that every point in the input
    data is equally weighted, thereby avoiding aliasing and allowing full
    reconstruction. Note that the algorithms implemented in `ShortTimeFFT.istft`
    and in `istft` (legacy) only require that the weaker "nonzero overlap-add"
    condition (as in `check_NOLA`) is met.

    Some examples of windows that satisfy COLA:
        - Rectangular window at overlap of 0, 1/2, 2/3, 3/4, ...
        - Bartlett window at overlap of 1/2, 3/4, 5/6, ...
        - Hann window at 1/2, 2/3, 3/4, ...
        - Any Blackman family window at 2/3 overlap
        - Any window with ``noverlap = nperseg-1``

    A very comprehensive list of other windows may be found in [2]_,
    wherein the COLA condition is satisfied when the "Amplitude
    Flatness" is unity.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from scipy import signal

    Confirm COLA condition for rectangular window of 75% (3/4) overlap:

    >>> signal.check_COLA(signal.windows.boxcar(100), 100, 75)
    True

    COLA is not true for 25% (1/4) overlap, though:

    >>> signal.check_COLA(signal.windows.boxcar(100), 100, 25)
    False

    "Symmetrical" Hann window (for filter design) is not COLA:

    >>> signal.check_COLA(signal.windows.hann(120, sym=True), 120, 60)
    False

    "Periodic" or "DFT-even" Hann window (for FFT analysis) is COLA for
    overlap of 1/2, 2/3, 3/4, etc.:

    >>> signal.check_COLA(signal.windows.hann(120, sym=False), 120, 60)
    True

    >>> signal.check_COLA(signal.windows.hann(120, sym=False), 120, 80)
    True

    >>> signal.check_COLA(signal.windows.hann(120, sym=False), 120, 90)
    True
