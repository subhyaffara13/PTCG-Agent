    When Python was built with --enable-shared on Unix, -L. is not enough to
    find libpython<blah>.so, because regrtest runs in a tempdir, not in the
    source directory where the .so lives.

    When Python was built with in debug mode on Windows, build_ext commands
    need their debug attribute set, and it is not done automatically for
    some reason.

    This function handles both of these things.  Example use:

        cmd = build_ext(dist)
        support.fixup_build_ext(cmd)
        cmd.ensure_finalized()

    Unlike most other Unix platforms, Mac OS X embeds absolute paths
    to shared libraries into executables, so the fixup is not needed there.
