    Print loops of cyclic references in the given *objects*.

    It is often useful to pass in ``gc.garbage`` to find the cycles that are

    ----------
    objects
        A list of objects to find cycles in.
    outstream
        The stream for output.
    show_progress : bool
        If True, print the number of objects reached as they are found.
