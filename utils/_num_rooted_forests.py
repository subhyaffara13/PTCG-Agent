def _num_rooted_forests(n, q, cache_forests):
    """Returns the number of unlabeled rooted forests with `n` nodes, and with
    no more than `q` nodes per tree. A recursive formula for this is (2) in
    [1]_. This function is implemented using dynamic programming instead of
    recursion.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : int
        The number of nodes.
    q : int
        The maximum number of nodes for each tree of the forest.
    cache_forests : list of ints
        The $i$-th element is the number of unlabeled rooted forests with
        $i$ nodes, and with no more than `q` nodes per tree; this is used
        as a cache (and is extended to length `n` + 1 if needed).

    Returns
    -------
    int
        The number of unlabeled rooted forests with `n` nodes with no more than
        `q` nodes per tree.
