    Optimize transform infos by merging consecutive same-type collectives into
    a single flattened operation when a matching flattened DeviceMesh exists.

    Merging requirements:
    - Operations must be consecutive in the transform list (no reordering).
      Notably, redistributing from P, P, P -> R, S, R is not optimized here and cannot be optimized due to
      optimization needing to fuse non-contiguous reductions, leaving this pattern vulnerable to numerics issues and
      suboptimal perf
    - Operations must have the same comm type (e.g., all allgather or all reduce_scatter)
    - Operations must have identical src_dst_placements (e.g., can't merge
      Partial->Shard(0) with Partial->Shard(1))
    - A flattened mesh covering the relevant dimensions must exist
    - For reduce_scatter, tensor dim must be evenly divisible by flattened mesh size

    For nested sharding, the merged operation uses the logical_shape from the
    outermost mesh dimension (smallest mesh_dim index) which represents the
    global tensor shape needed for correct padding/unpadding.

    TODO:
    - all_to_all operations are excluded from merging, but it may be possible to merge them in some cases.
