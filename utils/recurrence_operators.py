def RecurrenceOperators(base, generator):
    """
    Returns an Algebra of Recurrence Operators and the operator for
    shifting i.e. the `Sn` operator.
    The first argument needs to be the base polynomial ring for the algebra
    and the second argument must be a generator which can be either a
    noncommutative Symbol or a string.
