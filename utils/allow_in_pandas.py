    A monkeypatch to tells pandas to let us in.

    By default, passing a NumpyExtensionArray to an index / series / frame
    constructor will unbox that NumpyExtensionArray to an ndarray, and treat
    it as a non-EA column. We don't want people using EAs without
    reason.

    The mechanism for this is a check against ABCNumpyExtensionArray
    in each constructor.

    But, for testing, we need to allow them in pandas. So we patch
    the _typ of NumpyExtensionArray, so that we evade the ABCNumpyExtensionArray
    check.
