    The algorithm starts by picking a random number (a) and seeing if it is
    coprime with N. If it is not, then the gcd of the two numbers is a factor
    and we are done. Otherwise, it begins the period_finding subroutine which
    finds the period of a in modulo N arithmetic. This period, if even, can
    be used to calculate factors by taking a**(r/2)-1 and a**(r/2)+1.
    These values are returned.
