def resample(x, num, t=None, axis=0, window=None, domain='time'):
    r"""Resample `x` to `num` samples using the Fourier method along the given `axis`.

    The resampling is performed by shortening or zero-padding the FFT of `x`. This has
    the advantages of providing an ideal antialiasing filter and allowing arbitrary
    up- or down-sampling ratios. The main drawback is the requirement of assuming `x`
    to be a periodic signal.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array_like
        The input signal made up of equidistant samples. If `x` is a multidimensional
        array, the parameter `axis` specifies the time/frequency axis. It is assumed
        here that ``n_x = x.shape[axis]`` specifies the number of samples and ``T`` the
        sampling interval.
    num : int
        The number of samples of the resampled output signal. It may be larger or
        smaller than ``n_x``.
    t : array_like, optional
        If `t` is not ``None``, then the timestamps of the resampled signal are also
        returned. `t` must contain at least the first two timestamps of the input
        signal `x` (all others are ignored). The timestamps of the output signal are
        determined by ``t[0] + T * n_x / num * np.arange(num)`` with
        ``T = t[1] - t[0]``. Default is ``None``.
    axis : int, optional
        The time/frequency axis of `x` along which the resampling take place.
        The Default is 0.
    window : array_like, callable, str, float, or tuple, optional
        If not ``None``, it specifies a filter in the Fourier domain, which is applied
        before resampling. I.e., the FFT ``X`` of `x` is calculated by
        ``X = W * fft(x, axis=axis)``. ``W`` may be interpreted as a spectral windowing
        function ``W(f_X)`` which consumes the frequencies ``f_X = fftfreq(n_x, T)``.

        If `window` is a 1d array of length ``n_x`` then ``W=window``.
        If `window` is a callable  then ``W = window(f_X)``.
        Otherwise, `window` is passed to `~scipy.signal.get_window`, i.e.,
        ``W = fftshift(signal.get_window(window, n_x))``. Default is ``None``.

    domain : 'time' | 'freq', optional
        If set to ``'time'`` (default) then an FFT is applied to `x`, otherwise
        (``'freq'``) it is asssmued that an FFT was already applied, i.e.,
        ``x = fft(x_t, axis=axis)`` with ``x_t`` being the input signal in the time
        domain.

    Returns
    -------
    x_r : ndarray
        The resampled signal made up of `num` samples and sampling interval
        ``T * n_x / num``.
    t_r : ndarray, optional
        The `num` equidistant timestamps of `x_r`.
        This is only returned if paramater `t` is not ``None``.

    See Also
    --------
    decimate : Downsample a (periodic/non-periodic) signal after applying an FIR
               or IIR filter.
    resample_poly : Resample a (periodic/non-periodic) signal using polyphase filtering
                    and an FIR filter.

    Notes
    -----
    This function uses the more efficient one-sided FFT, i.e. `~scipy.fft.rfft` /
    `~scipy.fft.irfft`, if `x` is real-valued and in the time domain.
    Else, the two-sided FFT, i.e., `~scipy.fft.fft` / `~scipy.fft.ifft`, is used
    (all FFT functions are taken from the `scipy.fft` module).

    If a `window` is applied to a real-valued `x`, the one-sided spectral windowing
    function is determined by taking the average of the negative and the positive
    frequency component. This ensures that real-valued signals and complex signals with
    zero imaginary part are treated identically. I.e., passing `x` or passing
    ``x.astype(np.complex128)`` produce the same numeric result.

    If the number of input  or output samples are prime or have few prime factors, this
    function may be slow due to utilizing FFTs. Consult `~scipy.fft.prev_fast_len` and
    `~scipy.fft.next_fast_len` for determining efficient signals lengths.
    Alternatively, utilizing `resample_poly` to calculate an intermediate signal (as
    illustrated in the example below) can result in significant speed increases.

    `resample` is intended to be used for periodic signals with equidistant sampling
    intervals. For non-periodic signals, `resample_poly` may be a better choice.
    Consult the `scipy.interpolate` module for methods of resampling signals with
    non-constant sampling intervals.

    Examples
    --------
    The following example depicts a signal being up-sampled from 20 samples to 100
    samples. The ringing at the beginning of the up-sampled signal is due to
    interpreting the signal being periodic. The red square in the plot illustrates that
    periodictiy by showing the first sample of the next cycle of the signal.

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> from scipy.signal import resample
    ...
    >>> n0, n1 = 20, 100  # number of samples
    >>> t0 = np.linspace(0, 10, n0, endpoint=False)  # input time stamps
    >>> x0 = np.cos(-t0**2/6)  # input signal
    ...
    >>> x1 = resample(x0, n1)  # resampled signal
    >>> t1 = np.linspace(0, 10, n1, endpoint=False)  # timestamps of x1
    ...
    >>> fig0, ax0 = plt.subplots(1, 1, tight_layout=True)
    >>> ax0.set_title(f"Resampling $x(t)$ from {n0} samples to {n1} samples")
    >>> ax0.set(xlabel="Time $t$", ylabel="Amplitude $x(t)$")
    >>> ax0.plot(t1, x1, '.-', alpha=.5, label=f"Resampled")
    >>> ax0.plot(t0, x0, 'o-', alpha=.5, label="Original")
    >>> ax0.plot(10, x0[0], 'rs', alpha=.5, label="Next Cycle")
    >>> ax0.legend(loc='best')
    >>> ax0.grid(True)
    >>> plt.show()

    The following example compares this function with a naive `~scipy.fft.rfft` /
    `~scipy.fft.irfft` combination: An input signal with a sampling interval of one
    second is upsampled by a factor of eight. The first figure depicts an odd number of
    input samples whereas the second figure an even number. The upper subplots show the
    signals over time: The input samples are marked by large green dots, the upsampled
    signals by a continuous and a dashed line. The lower subplots show the magnitude
    spectrum: The FFT values of the input are depicted by large green dots, which lie
    in the frequency interval [-0.5, 0.5] Hz, whereas the frequency interval of the
    upsampled signal is [-4, 4] Hz. The continuous green line depicts the upsampled
    spectrum without antialiasing filter, which is a periodic continuation of the input
    spectrum. The blue x's and orange dots depict the FFT values of the signal created
    by the naive approach as well as this function's result.

    >>> plt.show()

    The first figure shows that upsampling an odd number of samples produces identical
    results. The second figure illustrates that the signal produced with the naive
    approach (dashed blue line) from an even number of samples does not touch all
    original samples. This deviation is due to `resample` correctly treating unpaired
    frequency bins. I.e., the input `x1` has a bin pair ±0.5 Hz, whereas the output has
    only one unpaired bin at -0.5 Hz, which demands rescaling of that bin pair.
    Generally, special treatment is required if ``n_x != num`` and ``min(n_x, num)`` is
    even. If the bin values at `±m` are zero, obviously, no special treatment is
    needed. Consult the source code of `resample` for details.

    The final example shows how to utilize `resample_poly` to speed up the
    down-sampling: The input signal a non-zero value at :math:`t=0` and is downsampled
    from 19937 to 128 samples. Since 19937 is prime, the FFT is expected to be slow. To
    speed matters up, `resample_poly` is used to downsample first by a factor of ``n0
    // n1 = 155`` and then pass the result to `resample`. Two parameterization of
    `resample_poly` are used: Passing ``padtype='wrap'`` treats the input as being
    periodic wheras the default parametrization performs zero-padding. The upper
    subplot shows the resulting signals over time whereas the lower subplot depicts the
    resulting one-sided magnitude spectra.

    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from scipy.fft import rfftfreq, rfft
    >>> from scipy.signal import resample, resample_poly
    ...
    >>> n0 = 19937 # number of input samples - prime
    >>> n1 = 128  # number of output samples - fast FFT length
    >>> T0, T1 = 1/n0, 1/n1  # sampling intervals
    >>> t0, t1 = np.arange(n0)*T0, np.arange(n1)*T1  # time stamps
    ...
    >>> x0 = np.zeros(n0)  # Input has one non-zero sample
    >>> x0[0] = n0
    >>>
    >>> x1r = resample(x0, n1)  # slow due to n0 being prime
    >>> # This is faster:
    >>> x1p = resample(resample_poly(x0, 1, n0 // n1, padtype='wrap'), n1)  # periodic
    >>> x2p = resample(resample_poly(x0, 1, n0 // n1), n1)  # with zero-padding
    ...
    >>> X0 = rfft(x0) / n0
    >>> X1r, X1p, X2p = rfft(x1r) / n1, rfft(x1p) / n1, rfft(x2p) / n1

    >>> ax0.set(xlabel="Time $t$ in seconds", ylabel="Amplitude $x(t)$", xlim=(-T1, 1))
    >>> for x_ in (x1r, x1p, x2p):
    ...     ax0.plot(t1, x_, alpha=.5)
    >>> ax0.grid()
    >>> ax1.set(xlabel=rf"Frequency $f$ in hertz ($\Delta f = {f1[1]}\,$Hz)",
    ...         ylabel="Magnitude $|X(f)|$", xlim=(0, 0.55/T1))
    >>> ax1.axvspan(0.5/T1, f0[-1], color='gray', alpha=.2)
    >>> ax1.plot(f1, abs(X1r), 'C0.-', alpha=.5, label="resample")
    >>> ax1.plot(f1, abs(X1p), 'C1.-', alpha=.5, label="resample_poly(padtype='wrap')")
    >>> ax1.plot(f1, abs(X2p), 'C2x-', alpha=.5, label="resample_poly")
    >>> ax1.grid()
    >>> fig.legend(loc='outside lower center', ncols=2)
    >>> plt.show()

    The plots show that the results of the "pure" `resample` and the usage of the
    default parameters of `resample_poly` agree well.  The periodic padding of
    `resample_poly` (``padtype='wrap'``) on the other hand produces significant
    deviations. This is caused by the disconiuity at the beginning of the signal, for
    which the default filter of `resample_poly` is not suited well. This example
    illustrates that for some use cases, adapting the `resample_poly` parameters may
    be beneficial. `resample` has a big advantage in this regard: It uses the ideal
    antialiasing filter with the maximum bandwidth by default.

    Note that the doubled spectral magnitude at the Nyqist frequency of 64 Hz is due the
    even number of ``n1=128`` output samples, which requires a special treatment as
    discussed in the previous example.
