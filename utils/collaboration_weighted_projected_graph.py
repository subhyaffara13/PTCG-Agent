def collaboration_weighted_projected_graph(B, nodes):
    r"""Newman's weighted projection of B onto one of its node sets.

    The collaboration weighted projection is the projection of the
    bipartite network B onto the specified nodes with weights assigned
    using Newman's collaboration model [1]_:

    .. math::

        w_{u, v} = \sum_k \frac{\delta_{u}^{k} \delta_{v}^{k}}{d_k - 1}

    where `u` and `v` are nodes from the bottom bipartite node set,
    and `k` is a node of the top node set.
    The value `d_k` is the degree of node `k` in the bipartite
    network and `\delta_{u}^{k}` is 1 if node `u` is
    linked to node `k` in the original bipartite graph or 0 otherwise.

    The nodes retain their attributes and are connected in the resulting
    graph if have an edge to a common node in the original bipartite
    graph.

    Parameters
    ----------
    B : NetworkX graph
      The input graph should be bipartite.

    nodes : list or iterable
      Nodes to project onto (the "bottom" nodes).

    Returns
    -------
    Graph : NetworkX graph
       A graph that is the projection onto the given nodes.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from networkx.algorithms import bipartite
    >>> B = nx.path_graph(5)
    >>> B.add_edge(1, 5)
    >>> G = bipartite.collaboration_weighted_projected_graph(B, [0, 2, 4, 5])
    >>> list(G)
    [0, 2, 4, 5]
    >>> for edge in sorted(G.edges(data=True)):
    ...     print(edge)
    (0, 2, {'weight': 0.5})
    (0, 5, {'weight': 0.5})
    (2, 4, {'weight': 1.0})
    (2, 5, {'weight': 0.5})

    Notes
    -----
    No attempt is made to verify that the input graph B is bipartite.
    The graph and node properties are (shallow) copied to the projected graph.

    See :mod:`bipartite documentation <networkx.algorithms.bipartite>`
    for further details on how bipartite graphs are handled in NetworkX.
