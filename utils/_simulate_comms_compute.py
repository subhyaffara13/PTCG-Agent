    """This function dry-run simulates the actions in the schedule from the perspective of all ranks, and flags
    any deadlocks caused by missing or misordered communications.  It also simulates any bubbles in time where a rank
    can not execute any action due to waiting for unmet dependencies.  The total number of simulator steps can be used
    as a metric for unit tests involving IR optimization passes as reordering and merging of IR can reduce the number
    of simulated steps.

    The simulation is not high-fidelity and does not model overlapping of compute and communication, or cuda streams.
    Future work may be to enhance this and model the compute time, comms overlap, and even memory.
