    r"""
    Make a blocking RPC call to run function ``func`` on worker ``to``. RPC
    messages are sent and received in parallel to execution of Python code. This
    method is thread-safe.

    Args:
        to (str or WorkerInfo or int): name/rank/``WorkerInfo`` of the destination worker.
        func (Callable): a callable function, such as Python callables, builtin
                         operators (e.g. :meth:`~torch.add`) and annotated
                         TorchScript functions.
        args (tuple): the argument tuple for the ``func`` invocation.
        kwargs (dict): is a dictionary of keyword arguments for the ``func``
                       invocation.
        timeout (float, optional): timeout in seconds to use for this RPC. If
                                   the RPC does not complete in this amount of
                                   time, an exception indicating it has
                                   timed out will be raised. A value of 0
                                   indicates an infinite timeout, i.e. a timeout
                                   error will never be raised. If not provided,
                                   the default value set during initialization
                                   or with ``_set_rpc_timeout`` is used.

    Returns:
        Returns the result of running ``func`` with ``args`` and ``kwargs``.

    Example::
        Make sure that ``MASTER_ADDR`` and ``MASTER_PORT`` are set properly
        on both workers. Refer to :meth:`~torch.distributed.init_process_group`
        API for more details. For example,

        export MASTER_ADDR=localhost
        export MASTER_PORT=5678

        Then run the following code in two different processes:

        >>> # xdoctest: +SKIP
        >>> # On worker 0:
        >>> import torch
        >>> import torch.distributed.rpc as rpc
        >>> rpc.init_rpc("worker0", rank=0, world_size=2)
        >>> ret = rpc.rpc_sync("worker1", torch.add, args=(torch.ones(2), 3))
        >>> rpc.shutdown()

        >>> # On worker 1:
        >>> import torch.distributed.rpc as rpc
        >>> rpc.init_rpc("worker1", rank=1, world_size=2)
        >>> rpc.shutdown()

        Below is an example of running a TorchScript function using RPC.

        >>> # On both workers:
        >>> @torch.jit.script
        >>> def my_script_add(tensor: torch.Tensor, scalar: int):
        >>>    return torch.add(tensor, scalar)

        >>> # On worker 0:
        >>> import torch.distributed.rpc as rpc
        >>> rpc.init_rpc("worker0", rank=0, world_size=2)
        >>> ret = rpc.rpc_sync("worker1", my_script_add, args=(torch.ones(2), 3))
        >>> rpc.shutdown()

        >>> # On worker 1:
        >>> import torch.distributed.rpc as rpc
        >>> rpc.init_rpc("worker1", rank=1, world_size=2)
        >>> rpc.shutdown()

    fut = _invoke_rpc(to, func, RPCExecMode.SYNC, args, kwargs, timeout)
    return fut.wait()
