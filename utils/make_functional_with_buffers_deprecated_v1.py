    Given an nn.Module, make_functional_with_buffers_deprecated_v1 extracts the state (weights and buffers)
    and returns a functional version of the model, `func`.

    `func` can be invoked as follows:
    ```
    x = torch.randn(4, 3)
    model = nn.Linear(3, 3)
    weights, buffers, func, _, _ = make_functional_with_buffers_deprecated_v1(model)
    func(weights, buffers, (x,))
    ```

    And here is an example of applying the grad transform:
    ```
    x = torch.randn(4, 3)
    model = nn.Linear(3, 3)
    weights, buffers, func, _, _ = make_functional_with_buffers_deprecated_v1(model)
    func(weights, buffers, (x,))
    grad_weights = grad(func)(weights, buffers, (x,))
    ```

    To put the state back into a model, use `load_state`.

    weights, weight_descriptors, _ = extract_weights(model)
    buffers, buf_descriptors, _ = extract_buffers(model)

        buffers: tuple[Tensor, ...],
        data: tuple[Any, ...],
    ) -> Any:
        mutable_model = copy.deepcopy(model)
        load_weights(mutable_model, weight_descriptors, weights)
        load_buffers(mutable_model, buf_descriptors, buffers)
        return mutable_model(*data)

    return weights, buffers, fun, weight_descriptors, buf_descriptors
