    """
    Compute the action of the matrix exponential at multiple time points.

    Parameters
    ----------
    A : transposable linear operator
        The operator whose exponential is of interest.
    B : ndarray
        The matrix to be multiplied by the matrix exponential of A.
    start : scalar, optional
        The starting time point of the sequence.
    stop : scalar, optional
        The end time point of the sequence, unless `endpoint` is set to False.
        In that case, the sequence consists of all but the last of ``num + 1``
        evenly spaced time points, so that `stop` is excluded.
        Note that the step size changes when `endpoint` is False.
    num : int, optional
        Number of time points to use.
    traceA : scalar, optional
        Trace of `A`. If not given the trace is estimated for linear operators,
        or calculated exactly for sparse matrices. It is used to precondition
        `A`, thus an approximate trace is acceptable
    endpoint : bool, optional
        If True, `stop` is the last time point. Otherwise, it is not included.
    balance : bool
        Indicates whether or not to apply balancing.
    status_only : bool
        A flag that is set to True for some debugging and testing operations.

    Returns
    -------
    F : ndarray
        :math:`e^{t_k A} B`
    status : int
        An integer status for testing and debugging.

    Notes
    -----
    This is algorithm (5.2) in Al-Mohy and Higham (2011).

    There seems to be a typo, where line 15 of the algorithm should be
    moved to line 6.5 (between lines 6 and 7).
