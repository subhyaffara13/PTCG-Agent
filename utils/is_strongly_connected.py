def is_strongly_connected(G):
    """Decides whether the given tournament is strongly connected.

    This function is more theoretically efficient than the
    :func:`~networkx.algorithms.components.is_strongly_connected`
    function.

    The given graph **must** be a tournament, otherwise this function's
    behavior is undefined.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
        A directed graph representing a tournament.

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        Whether the tournament is strongly connected.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.DiGraph([(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 0)])
    >>> nx.is_tournament(G)
    True
    >>> nx.tournament.is_strongly_connected(G)
    True
    >>> G.remove_edge(3, 0)
    >>> G.add_edge(0, 3)
    >>> nx.is_tournament(G)
    True
    >>> nx.tournament.is_strongly_connected(G)
    False

    Notes
    -----
    Although this function is more theoretically efficient than the
    generic strong connectivity function, a speedup requires the use of
    parallelism. Though it may in the future, the current implementation
    does not use parallelism, thus you may not see much of a speedup.

    This algorithm comes from [1].

    Returns
