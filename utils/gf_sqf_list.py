    Return the square-free decomposition of a ``GF(p)[x]`` polynomial.

    Given a polynomial ``f`` in ``GF(p)[x]``, returns the leading coefficient
    of ``f`` and a square-free decomposition ``f_1**e_1 f_2**e_2 ... f_k**e_k``
    such that all ``f_i`` are monic polynomials and ``(f_i, f_j)`` for ``i != j``
    are co-prime and ``e_1 ... e_k`` are given in increasing order. All trivial
    terms (i.e. ``f_i = 1``) are not included in the output.

    Consider polynomial ``f = x**11 + 1`` over ``GF(11)[x]``::

       >>> from sympy.polys.domains import ZZ

       >>> from sympy.polys.galoistools import (
       ...     gf_from_dict, gf_diff, gf_sqf_list, gf_pow,
       ... )
       ... # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE

       >>> f = gf_from_dict({11: ZZ(1), 0: ZZ(1)}, 11, ZZ)

    Note that ``f'(x) = 0``::

       >>> gf_diff(f, 11, ZZ)
       []

    This phenomenon does not happen in characteristic zero. However we can
    still compute square-free decomposition of ``f`` using ``gf_sqf()``::

       >>> gf_sqf_list(f, 11, ZZ)
       (1, [([1, 1], 11)])

    We obtained factorization ``f = (x + 1)**11``. This is correct because::

       >>> gf_pow([1, 1], 11, 11, ZZ) == f
       True
