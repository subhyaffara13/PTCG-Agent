def fisher_exact(table, alternative=None, *, method=None):
    """Perform a Fisher exact test on a contingency table.

    For a 2x2 table,
    the null hypothesis is that the true odds ratio of the populations
    underlying the observations is one, and the observations were sampled
    from these populations under a condition: the marginals of the
    resulting table must equal those of the observed table.
    The statistic is the unconditional maximum likelihood estimate of the odds
    ratio, and the p-value is the probability under the null hypothesis of
    obtaining a table at least as extreme as the one that was actually
    observed.

    For other table sizes, or if `method` is provided, the null hypothesis
    is that the rows and columns of the tables have fixed sums and are
    independent; i.e., the table was sampled from a `scipy.stats.random_table`
    distribution with the observed marginals. The statistic is the
    probability mass of this distribution evaluated at `table`, and the
    p-value is the percentage of the population of tables with statistic at
    least as extreme (small) as that of `table`. There is only one alternative
    hypothesis available: the rows and columns are not independent.

    There are other possible choices of statistic and two-sided
    p-value definition associated with Fisher's exact test; please see the
    Notes for more information.

    Parameters
    ----------
    table : array_like of ints
        A contingency table.  Elements must be non-negative integers.
    alternative : {'two-sided', 'less', 'greater'}, optional
        Defines the alternative hypothesis for 2x2 tables; unused for other
        table sizes.
        The following options are available (default is 'two-sided'):

        * 'two-sided': the odds ratio of the underlying population is not one
        * 'less': the odds ratio of the underlying population is less than one
        * 'greater': the odds ratio of the underlying population is greater
          than one

        See the Notes for more details.

    method : ResamplingMethod, optional
        Defines the method used to compute the p-value.
        If `method` is an instance of `PermutationMethod`/`MonteCarloMethod`,
        the p-value is computed using
        `scipy.stats.permutation_test`/`scipy.stats.monte_carlo_test` with the
        provided configuration options and other appropriate settings.
        Note that if `method` is an instance of `MonteCarloMethod`, the ``rvs``
        attribute must be left unspecified; Monte Carlo samples are always drawn
        using the ``rvs`` method of `scipy.stats.random_table`.
        Otherwise, the p-value is computed as documented in the notes.

        .. versionadded:: 1.15.0

    Returns
    -------
    res : SignificanceResult
        An object containing attributes:

        statistic : float
            For a 2x2 table with default `method`, this is the odds ratio - the
            prior odds ratio not a posterior estimate. In all other cases, this
            is the probability density of obtaining the observed table under the
            null hypothesis of independence with marginals fixed.
        pvalue : float
            The probability under the null hypothesis of obtaining a
            table at least as extreme as the one that was actually observed.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If `table` is not two-dimensional or has negative entries.

    See Also
    --------

        contingency table.  This can be used as an alternative to

    contingency.odds_ratio : Compute the odds ratio (sample or conditional
        MLE) for a 2x2 contingency table.

    Notes
    -----
    *Null hypothesis and p-values*

    The null hypothesis is that the true odds ratio of the populations
    underlying the observations is one, and the observations were sampled at
    random from these populations under a condition: the marginals of the
    resulting table must equal those of the observed table. Equivalently,
    the null hypothesis is that the input table is from the hypergeometric
    distribution with parameters (as used in `hypergeom`)
    ``M = a + b + c + d``, ``n = a + b`` and ``N = a + c``, where the
    input table is ``[[a, b], [c, d]]``.  This distribution has support
    ``max(0, N + n - M) <= x <= min(N, n)``, or, in terms of the values
    in the input table, ``min(0, a - d) <= x <= a + min(b, c)``.  ``x``
    can be interpreted as the upper-left element of a 2x2 table, so the
    tables in the distribution have form::

        [  x           n - x     ]
        [N - x    M - (n + N) + x]

    For example, if::

        table = [6  2]
                [1  4]

    then the support is ``2 <= x <= 7``, and the tables in the distribution
    are::

        [2 6]   [3 5]   [4 4]   [5 3]   [6 2]  [7 1]
        [5 0]   [4 1]   [3 2]   [2 3]   [1 4]  [0 5]

    The probability of each table is given by the hypergeometric distribution
    ``hypergeom.pmf(x, M, n, N)``.  For this example, these are (rounded to
    three significant digits)::

        x       2      3      4      5       6        7
        p  0.0163  0.163  0.408  0.326  0.0816  0.00466

    These can be computed with::

        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> from scipy.stats import hypergeom
        >>> table = np.array([[6, 2], [1, 4]])
        >>> M = table.sum()
        >>> n = table[0].sum()
        >>> N = table[:, 0].sum()
        >>> start, end = hypergeom.support(M, n, N)
        >>> hypergeom.pmf(np.arange(start, end+1), M, n, N)
        array([0.01631702, 0.16317016, 0.40792541, 0.32634033, 0.08158508,
               0.004662  ])

    The two-sided p-value is the probability that, under the null hypothesis,
    a random table would have a probability equal to or less than the
    probability of the input table.  For our example, the probability of
    the input table (where ``x = 6``) is 0.0816.  The x values where the
    probability does not exceed this are 2, 6 and 7, so the two-sided p-value
    is ``0.0163 + 0.0816 + 0.00466 ~= 0.10256``::

        >>> from scipy.stats import fisher_exact
        >>> res = fisher_exact(table, alternative='two-sided')
        >>> res.pvalue
        0.10256410256410257

    The one-sided p-value for ``alternative='greater'`` is the probability
    that a random table has ``x >= a``, which in our example is ``x >= 6``,
    or ``0.0816 + 0.00466 ~= 0.08626``::

        >>> res = fisher_exact(table, alternative='greater')
        >>> res.pvalue
        0.08624708624708627

    This is equivalent to computing the survival function of the
    distribution at ``x = 5`` (one less than ``x`` from the input table,
    because we want to include the probability of ``x = 6`` in the sum)::

        >>> hypergeom.sf(5, M, n, N)
        0.08624708624708627

    For ``alternative='less'``, the one-sided p-value is the probability
    that a random table has ``x <= a``, (i.e. ``x <= 6`` in our example),
    or ``0.0163 + 0.163 + 0.408 + 0.326 + 0.0816 ~= 0.9949``::

        >>> res = fisher_exact(table, alternative='less')
        >>> res.pvalue
        0.9953379953379957

    This is equivalent to computing the cumulative distribution function
    of the distribution at ``x = 6``:

        >>> hypergeom.cdf(6, M, n, N)
        0.9953379953379957

    *Odds ratio*

    The calculated odds ratio is different from the value computed by the
    R function ``fisher.test``.  This implementation returns the "sample"
    or "unconditional" maximum likelihood estimate, while ``fisher.test``
    in R uses the conditional maximum likelihood estimate.  To compute the
    conditional maximum likelihood estimate of the odds ratio, use
    `scipy.stats.contingency.odds_ratio`.
