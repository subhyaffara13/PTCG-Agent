    r"""Compute variable-length attention using Flash Attention.

    This function is similar to scaled_dot_product_attention but optimized for
    variable-length sequences using cumulative sequence position tensors.

    Args:
        query (Tensor): Query tensor; shape :math:`(T_q, H_q, D)`
        key (Tensor): Key tensor; shape :math:`(T_k, H_{kv}, D)`, or
            :math:`(\text{total\_pages}, \text{page\_size}, H_{kv}, D)` when ``block_table`` is provided.
        value (Tensor): Value tensor; shape :math:`(T_k, H_{kv}, D)`, or
            :math:`(\text{total\_pages}, \text{page\_size}, H_{kv}, D)` when ``block_table`` is provided.
        cu_seq_q (Tensor): Cumulative sequence positions for queries; shape :math:`(N+1,)`
        cu_seq_k (Tensor): Cumulative sequence positions for keys/values; shape :math:`(N+1,)`
        max_q (int): Maximum query sequence length in the batch.
        max_k (int): Maximum key/value sequence length in the batch.
        return_aux (Optional[AuxRequest]): If not None and ``return_aux.lse`` is True, also returns the logsumexp tensor.
        scale (float, optional): Scaling factor for attention scores
        window_size (tuple[int, int], optional): Window size for sliding window attention as (left, right).
            Use (-1, -1) for full attention (default), (-1, 0) for causal attention,
            or (W, 0) for causal attention with sliding window of size W.
        enable_gqa (bool): If set to True, enables Grouped Query Attention (GQA)
            and allows key/value to have fewer heads than query.
            Each KV head is shared by a group of :math:`H_q / H_{kv}` query heads,
            so :math:`H_q` must be divisible by :math:`H_{kv}`.
            Default is False.
        seqused_k (Tensor, optional): Number of valid KV tokens per batch element; shape :math:`(N,)`.
            When set, only the first ``seqused_k[i]`` tokens in the key/value sequence for batch
            element *i* participate in attention. Useful for KV-cache decoding where the cache slot
            is larger than the actual sequence. Inference-only (not supported in backward).
        block_table (Tensor, optional): Block table for paged KV cache; shape
            :math:`(N, \text{max\_pages\_per\_seq})`, dtype ``int32``.
            Requires ``seqused_k``. Inference-only (not supported in backward).

            When ``block_table`` is provided, ``key`` and ``value`` are a "pool" of
            pages of tokens of KV data and the pages belong to any sequence/order.
            The ``block_table`` is what maps each sequence's logical chunks
            back to physical pages in this pool.

            ``seqused_k[i]`` tells the kernel how many tokens in sequence *i* are
            actually valid, since the last page is typically only partially filled.
        num_splits (int, optional): Number of splits for split-KV. Set to ``1``
            to disable split-KV which enables batch invariance. Split-KV
            parallelizes the key/value sequence dimension across multiple thread
            blocks and combines partial results. The split decision depends
            on ``max_k`` (the longest sequence in the batch), so different batch
            compositions can change the reduction order and produce different
            floating-point results for the same sequence. When this is disabled,
            bitwise identical outputs are guaranteed for a given sequence
            regardless of what other sequences are in the batch, at the
            cost of lower GPU utilization when there are few queries. When
            ``None`` (default), the kernel chooses automatically.

    Returns:
        output (Tensor): Output tensor from attention computation; shape :math:`(T_q, H_q, D)`.

        If ``return_aux`` is not None and ``return_aux.lse`` is True:
            lse (Tensor): Log-sum-exp of attention scores; shape :math:`(T_q, H_q)`.

    Shape legend:
        - :math:`N`: Batch size
        - :math:`T_q`: Total number of query tokens in the batch (sum of all query sequence lengths)
        - :math:`T_k`: Total number of key/value tokens in the batch (sum of all key/value sequence lengths)
        - :math:`H_q`: Number of query attention heads
        - :math:`H_{kv}`: Number of key/value attention heads (equal to :math:`H_q` unless GQA is enabled)
        - :math:`D`: Head dimension
