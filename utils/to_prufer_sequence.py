def to_prufer_sequence(T):
    r"""Returns the Prüfer sequence of the given tree.

    A *Prüfer sequence* is a list of *n* - 2 numbers between 0 and
    *n* - 1, inclusive. The tree corresponding to a given Prüfer
    sequence can be recovered by repeatedly joining a node in the
    sequence with a node with the smallest potential degree according to
    the sequence.

    Parameters
    ----------
    T : NetworkX graph
        An undirected graph object representing a tree.

    Returns
    -------
    list
        The Prüfer sequence of the given tree.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXPointlessConcept
        If the number of nodes in `T` is less than two.

    NotATree
        If `T` is not a tree.

    KeyError
        If the set of nodes in `T` is not {0, …, *n* - 1}.

    Notes
    -----
    There is a bijection from labeled trees to Prüfer sequences. This
    function is the inverse of the :func:`from_prufer_sequence`
    function.

    Sometimes Prüfer sequences use nodes labeled from 1 to *n* instead
    of from 0 to *n* - 1. This function requires nodes to be labeled in
    the latter form. You can use :func:`~networkx.relabel_nodes` to
    relabel the nodes of your tree to the appropriate format.

    This implementation is from [1]_ and has a running time of
    $O(n)$.

    Examples
    --------
    There is a bijection between Prüfer sequences and labeled trees, so
    this function is the inverse of the :func:`from_prufer_sequence`
    function:

    >>> edges = [(0, 3), (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5)]
    >>> tree = nx.Graph(edges)
    >>> sequence = nx.to_prufer_sequence(tree)
    >>> sequence
    [3, 3, 3, 4]
    >>> tree2 = nx.from_prufer_sequence(sequence)
    >>> list(tree2.edges()) == edges
    True
