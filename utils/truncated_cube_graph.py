def truncated_cube_graph(create_using=None):
    """
    Returns the skeleton of the truncated cube.

    The truncated cube is an Archimedean solid with 14 regular
    faces (6 octagonal and 8 triangular), 36 edges and 24 nodes [1]_.
    The truncated cube is created by truncating (cutting off) the tips
    of the cube one third of the way into each edge [2]_.

    Parameters
    ----------
    create_using : NetworkX graph constructor, optional (default=nx.Graph)
       Graph type to create. If graph instance, then cleared before populated.

    Returns
    -------
    G : networkx Graph
        Skeleton of the truncated cube
