    Rewrites a list of expressions as integer multiples of each other.

    Explanation
    ===========

    For example, if you have [x, x/2, x**2 + 1, 2*x/3], then you can rewrite
    this as [(x/6) * 6, (x/6) * 3, (x**2 + 1) * 1, (x/6) * 4]. This is useful
    in the Risch integration algorithm, where we must write exp(x) + exp(x/2)
    as (exp(x/2))**2 + exp(x/2), but not as exp(x) + sqrt(exp(x)) (this is
    because only the transcendental case is implemented and we therefore cannot
    integrate algebraic extensions). The integer multiples returned by this
    function for each term are the smallest possible (their content equals 1).

    Returns a list of tuples where the first element is the base term and the
    second element is a list of `(item, factor)` terms, where `factor` is the
    integer multiplicative factor that must multiply the base term to obtain
    the original item.

    The easiest way to understand this is to look at an example:

    >>> from sympy.abc import x
    >>> from sympy.integrals.risch import integer_powers
    >>> integer_powers([x, x/2, x**2 + 1, 2*x/3])
    [(x/6, [(x, 6), (x/2, 3), (2*x/3, 4)]), (x**2 + 1, [(x**2 + 1, 1)])]

    We can see how this relates to the example at the beginning of the
    docstring.  It chose x/6 as the first base term.  Then, x can be written as
    (x/2) * 2, so we get (0, 2), and so on. Now only element (x**2 + 1)
    remains, and there are no other terms that can be written as a rational
    multiple of that, so we get that it can be written as (x**2 + 1) * 1.

    """
    # Here is the strategy:

    # First, go through each term and determine if it can be rewritten as a
    # rational multiple of any of the terms gathered so far.
    # cancel(a/b).is_Rational is sufficient for this.  If it is a multiple, we
    # add its multiple to the dictionary.

    terms = {}
    for term in exprs:
        for trm, trm_list in terms.items():
            a = cancel(term/trm)
            if a.is_Rational:
                trm_list.append((term, a))
                break
        else:
            terms[term] = [(term, S.One)]

    # After we have done this, we have all the like terms together, so we just
    # need to find a common denominator so that we can get the base term and
    # integer multiples such that each term can be written as an integer
    # multiple of the base term, and the content of the integers is 1.

    newterms = {}
    for term, term_list in terms.items():
        common_denom = reduce(ilcm, [i.as_numer_denom()[1] for _, i in
            term_list])
        newterm = term/common_denom
        newmults = [(i, j*common_denom) for i, j in term_list]
        newterms[newterm] = newmults

    return sorted(iter(newterms.items()), key=lambda item: item[0].sort_key())
