def relabel_nodes(G, mapping, copy=True):
    """Relabel the nodes of the graph G according to a given mapping.

    The original node ordering may not be preserved if `copy` is `False` and the
    mapping includes overlap between old and new labels.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
       A NetworkX graph

    mapping : dictionary
       A dictionary with the old labels as keys and new labels as values.
       A partial mapping is allowed. Mapping 2 nodes to a single node is allowed.
       Any non-node keys in the mapping are ignored.

    copy : bool (optional, default=True)
       If True return a copy, or if False relabel the nodes in place.

    Examples
    --------
    To create a new graph with nodes relabeled according to a given
    dictionary:

    >>> G = nx.path_graph(3)
    >>> sorted(G)
    [0, 1, 2]
    >>> mapping = {0: "a", 1: "b", 2: "c"}
    >>> H = nx.relabel_nodes(G, mapping)
    >>> sorted(H)
    ['a', 'b', 'c']

    Nodes can be relabeled with any hashable object, including numbers
    and strings:

    >>> import string
    >>> G = nx.path_graph(26)  # nodes are integers 0 through 25
    >>> sorted(G)[:3]
    [0, 1, 2]
    >>> mapping = dict(zip(G, string.ascii_lowercase))
    >>> G = nx.relabel_nodes(G, mapping)  # nodes are characters a through z
    >>> sorted(G)[:3]
    ['a', 'b', 'c']
    >>> mapping = dict(zip(G, range(1, 27)))
    >>> G = nx.relabel_nodes(G, mapping)  # nodes are integers 1 through 26
    >>> sorted(G)[:3]
    [1, 2, 3]

    To perform a partial in-place relabeling, provide a dictionary
    mapping only a subset of the nodes, and set the `copy` keyword
    argument to False:

    >>> G = nx.path_graph(3)  # nodes 0-1-2
    >>> mapping = {0: "a", 1: "b"}  # 0->'a' and 1->'b'
    >>> G = nx.relabel_nodes(G, mapping, copy=False)
    >>> sorted(G, key=str)
    [2, 'a', 'b']

    A mapping can also be given as a function:

    >>> G = nx.path_graph(3)
    >>> H = nx.relabel_nodes(G, lambda x: x**2)
    >>> list(H)
    [0, 1, 4]

    In a multigraph, relabeling two or more nodes to the same new node
    will retain all edges, but may change the edge keys in the process:

    >>> G = nx.MultiGraph()
    >>> G.add_edge(0, 1, value="a")  # returns the key for this edge
    0
    >>> G.add_edge(0, 2, value="b")
    0
    >>> G.add_edge(0, 3, value="c")
    0
    >>> mapping = {1: 4, 2: 4, 3: 4}
    >>> H = nx.relabel_nodes(G, mapping, copy=True)
    >>> print(H[0])
    {4: {0: {'value': 'a'}, 1: {'value': 'b'}, 2: {'value': 'c'}}}

    This works for in-place relabeling too:

    >>> G = nx.relabel_nodes(G, mapping, copy=False)
    >>> print(G[0])
    {4: {0: {'value': 'a'}, 1: {'value': 'b'}, 2: {'value': 'c'}}}

    Notes
    -----
    Only the nodes specified in the mapping will be relabeled.
    Any non-node keys in the mapping are ignored.

    The keyword setting copy=False modifies the graph in place.
    Relabel_nodes avoids naming collisions by building a
    directed graph from ``mapping`` which specifies the order of
    relabelings. Naming collisions, such as a->b, b->c, are ordered
    such that "b" gets renamed to "c" before "a" gets renamed "b".
    In cases of circular mappings (e.g. a->b, b->a), modifying the
    graph is not possible in-place and an exception is raised.
    In that case, use copy=True.

    If a relabel operation on a multigraph would cause two or more
    edges to have the same source, target and key, the second edge must
    be assigned a new key to retain all edges. The new key is set
    to the lowest non-negative integer not already used as a key
    for edges between these two nodes. Note that this means non-numeric
    keys may be replaced by numeric keys.
