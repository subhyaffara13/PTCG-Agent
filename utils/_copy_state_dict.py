    """
    Copies all tensors in a given state dict into a different state_dict with the
    same structure. Additionally, a copied state dict with the same value references
    is returned. Editing the keys on this state dict will not affect the
    passed in copy_state_dict (but the value references are the same).

    .. warning::
        It is expected by this function that state_dict and copy_state_dict share
        the same structure and data types.

    .. warning::
        The current supported data types are
            torch.Tensor, DTensor, int, float, str, list, dict, None.

    Args:
        state_dict (Dict[str, Any]): the target state_dict.
        copy_state_dict (Dict[str, Any]):
            The state dict we are copying into. This state_dict must have exactly
             the same structure as the source `state_dict`.
        non_blocking: (bool): Whether copy ops should be performed asynchronously
        type_check (bool): check if the instance data type is a supported type
            that can be saved by DCP. The current supported data types are
            torch.Tensor, DTensor, int, float, str, list, dict, None.
