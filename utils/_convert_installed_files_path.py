    The legacy format stores paths relative to the info directory, while the

    site-packages directory.

    :param info: Path parts of the egg-info directory relative to package root.
    :returns: The converted entry.

    For best compatibility with symlinks, this does not use ``abspath()`` or
    ``Path.resolve()``, but tries to work with path parts:

    1. While ``entry`` starts with ``..``, remove the equal amounts of parts
       from ``info``; if ``info`` is empty, start appending ``..`` instead.
    2. Join the two directly.
