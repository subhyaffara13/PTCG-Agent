    """Like :func:`tree_map`, but the provided callable takes an additional key path argument.

    Args:
        func: A function that takes ``2 + len(rests)`` arguments, to be applied at the
            corresponding leaves of the pytrees. The first positional argument
            to ``func`` is the key path of the leaf in question. The second
            positional argument is the value of the leaf.
        tree: A pytree to be mapped over, with each leaf providing the first positional
            argument to function ``func``.
        rests: A tuple of pytrees, each of which has the same structure as
            ``tree`` or has ``tree`` as a prefix.
        is_leaf: An extra leaf predicate function that will be called at each
            flattening step. The function should have a single argument with signature
            ``is_leaf(node) -> bool``. If it returns :data:`True`, the whole subtree being treated
            as a leaf. Otherwise, the default pytree registry will be used to determine a node is a
            leaf or not. If the function is not specified, the default pytree registry will be used.

    Returns
        A new pytree with the same structure as ``tree`` but with the value at each leaf given by
        ``func(keypath, x, *xs)`` where ``keypath`` is the key path at the
        corresponding leaf in ``tree``, ``x`` is the value at that leaf, and
        ``xs`` is the tuple of values at corresponding nodes in ``rests``.
