    """Given a path or paths, return a list of ``OpenFile`` objects.

    For writing, a str path must contain the "*" character, which will be filled
    in by increasing numbers, e.g., "part*" ->  "part1", "part2" if num=2.

    For either reading or writing, can instead provide explicit list of paths.

    Parameters
    ----------
    urlpath: string or list
        Absolute or relative filepath(s). Prefix with a protocol like ``s3://``
        to read from alternative filesystems. To read from multiple files you
        can pass a globstring or a list of paths, with the caveat that they
        must all have the same protocol.
    mode: 'rb', 'wt', etc.
    compression: string or None
        If given, open file using compression codec. Can either be a compression
        name (a key in ``fsspec.compression.compr``) or "infer" to guess the
        compression from the filename suffix.
    encoding: str
        For text mode only
    errors: None or str
        Passed to TextIOWrapper in text mode
    name_function: function or None
        if opening a set of files for writing, those files do not yet exist,
        so we need to generate their names by formatting the urlpath for
        each sequence number
    num: int [1]
        if writing mode, number of files we expect to create (passed to
        name+function)
    protocol: str or None
        If given, overrides the protocol found in the URL.
    newline: bytes or None
        Used for line terminator in text mode. If None, uses system default;
        if blank, uses no translation.
    auto_mkdir: bool (True)
        If in write mode, this will ensure the target directory exists before
        writing, by calling ``fs.mkdirs(exist_ok=True)``.
    expand: bool
    **kwargs: dict
        Extra options that make sense to a particular storage connection, e.g.
        host, port, username, password, etc.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> files = open_files('2015-*-*.csv')  # doctest: +SKIP
    >>> files = open_files(
    ...     's3://bucket/2015-*-*.csv.gz', compression='gzip'
    ... )  # doctest: +SKIP

    Returns
    -------
    An ``OpenFiles`` instance, which is a list of ``OpenFile`` objects that can
    be used as a single context
