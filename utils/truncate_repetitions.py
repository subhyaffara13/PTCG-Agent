    """
    Attempt to truncate repeating segments in the input string.

    This function looks for the longest repeating substring at the end of the input string and truncates it to appear
    only once. To be considered for removal, repetitions need to be continuous.

    Args:
        text (`str`):
            The input raw prediction to be truncated.
        min_len (int):
            The minimum length of the repeating segment.

    Returns:
        `str`: The input string with repeated segments truncated.
