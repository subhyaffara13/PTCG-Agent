    """Build a ``pl.BlockSpec`` for *buf_shape* given tiling of *ref_shape*.

    Lower-ndim buffers are right-aligned with the reference shape (numpy
    broadcast rules).  Dimensions that match a tiled reference dimension
    are tiled; broadcast dimensions (size 1 or absent) are kept full.

    When *buf_nd > ref_nd* (reduction inputs), we find an alignment offset
    so the ref dims map into the buffer.  Extra dims are kept at full size
    with index 0 in the index_map.

    When *permutation* is given (a tuple mapping ref axis -> buf axis),
    the buffer dimensions are accessed in permuted order relative to the
    reference shape.  For example, permutation=(1, 0) swaps the last two.

    When *is_output* is True and *buf_nd < ref_nd*, left-alignment is used
    as a fallback (for reduction outputs whose trailing dims were reduced).
