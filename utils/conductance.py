    """Returns the conductance of two sets of nodes.

    The *conductance* is the quotient of the cut size and the smaller of
    the volumes of the two sets. [1]

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    S : collection
        A collection of nodes in `G`.

    T : collection
        A collection of nodes in `G`.

    weight : object
        Edge attribute key to use as weight. If not specified, edges
        have weight one.

    Returns
    -------
    number
        The conductance between the two sets `S` and `T`.
