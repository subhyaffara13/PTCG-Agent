    r"""Given a sample of a distribution, estimate the differential entropy.

    Several estimation methods are available using the `method` parameter. By
    default, a method is selected based the size of the sample.

    Parameters
    ----------
    values : sequence
        Sample from a continuous distribution.
    window_length : int, optional
        Window length for computing Vasicek estimate. Must be an integer
        between 1 and half of the sample size. If ``None`` (the default), it
        uses the heuristic value

        .. math::
            \left \lfloor \sqrt{n} + 0.5 \right \rfloor

        where :math:`n` is the sample size. This heuristic was originally
        proposed in [2]_ and has become common in the literature.
    base : float, optional
        The logarithmic base to use, defaults to ``e`` (natural logarithm).
    axis : int, optional
        The axis along which the differential entropy is calculated.
        Default is 0.
    method : {'vasicek', 'van es', 'ebrahimi', 'correa', 'auto'}, optional
        The method used to estimate the differential entropy from the sample.
        Default is ``'auto'``.  See Notes for more information.

    Returns
    -------
    entropy : float
        The calculated differential entropy.

    Notes
    -----
    This function will converge to the true differential entropy in the limit

    .. math::
        n \to \infty, \quad m \to \infty, \quad \frac{m}{n} \to 0

    The optimal choice of ``window_length`` for a given sample size depends on
    the (unknown) distribution. Typically, the smoother the density of the
    distribution, the larger the optimal value of ``window_length`` [1]_.

    The following options are available for the `method` parameter.

    * ``'vasicek'`` uses the estimator presented in [1]_. This is
      one of the first and most influential estimators of differential entropy.
    * ``'van es'`` uses the bias-corrected estimator presented in [3]_, which
      is not only consistent but, under some conditions, asymptotically normal.
    * ``'ebrahimi'`` uses an estimator presented in [4]_, which was shown
      in simulation to have smaller bias and mean squared error than
      the Vasicek estimator.
    * ``'correa'`` uses the estimator presented in [5]_ based on local linear
      regression. In a simulation study, it had consistently smaller mean
      square error than the Vasiceck estimator, but it is more expensive to
      compute.
    * ``'auto'`` selects the method automatically (default). Currently,
      this selects ``'van es'`` for very small samples (<10), ``'ebrahimi'``
      for moderate sample sizes (11-1000), and ``'vasicek'`` for larger
      samples, but this behavior is subject to change in future versions.

    All estimators are implemented as described in [6]_.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from scipy.stats import differential_entropy, norm

    Entropy of a standard normal distribution:

    >>> rng = np.random.default_rng()
    >>> values = rng.standard_normal(100)
    >>> differential_entropy(values)
    1.3407817436640392

    Compare with the true entropy:

    >>> float(norm.entropy())
    1.4189385332046727

    For several sample sizes between 5 and 1000, compare the accuracy of
    the ``'vasicek'``, ``'van es'``, and ``'ebrahimi'`` methods. Specifically,
    compare the root mean squared error (over 1000 trials) between the estimate
    and the true differential entropy of the distribution.

    >>> from scipy import stats

    >>> expected = stats.expon.entropy()

    >>> method_errors = {'vasicek': [], 'van es': [], 'ebrahimi': []}

    ...        error = rmse(res, expected)
