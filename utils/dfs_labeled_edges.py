def dfs_labeled_edges(G, source=None, depth_limit=None, *, sort_neighbors=None):
    """Iterate over edges in a depth-first-search (DFS) labeled by type.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    source : node, optional
       Specify starting node for depth-first search and return edges in
       the component reachable from source.

    depth_limit : int, optional (default=len(G))
       Specify the maximum search depth.

    sort_neighbors : function (default=None)
        A function that takes an iterator over nodes as the input, and
        returns an iterable of the same nodes with a custom ordering.
        For example, `sorted` will sort the nodes in increasing order.

    Returns
    -------
    edges: generator
       A generator of triples of the form (*u*, *v*, *d*), where (*u*,
       *v*) is the edge being explored in the depth-first search and *d*
       is one of the strings 'forward', 'nontree', 'reverse', or 'reverse-depth_limit'.
       A 'forward' edge is one in which *u* has been visited but *v* has
       not. A 'nontree' edge is one in which both *u* and *v* have been
       visited but the edge is not in the DFS tree. A 'reverse' edge is
       one in which both *u* and *v* have been visited and the edge is in
       the DFS tree. When the `depth_limit` is reached via a 'forward' edge,
       a 'reverse' edge is immediately generated rather than the subtree
       being explored. To indicate this flavor of 'reverse' edge, the string
       yielded is 'reverse-depth_limit'.

    Examples
    --------

    The labels reveal the complete transcript of the depth-first search
    algorithm in more detail than, for example, :func:`dfs_edges`::

        >>> from pprint import pprint
        >>>
        >>> G = nx.DiGraph([(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1)])
        >>> pprint(list(nx.dfs_labeled_edges(G, source=0)))
        [(0, 0, 'forward'),
         (0, 1, 'forward'),
         (1, 2, 'forward'),
         (2, 1, 'nontree'),
         (1, 2, 'reverse'),
         (0, 1, 'reverse'),
         (0, 0, 'reverse')]

    Notes
    -----
    If a source is not specified then a source is chosen arbitrarily and
    repeatedly until all components in the graph are searched.

    The implementation of this function is adapted from David Eppstein's
    depth-first search function in `PADS`_, with modifications
    to allow depth limits based on the Wikipedia article
    "`Depth-limited search`_".
