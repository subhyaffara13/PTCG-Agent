    The Risch Integration Algorithm.

    Explanation
    ===========

    Only transcendental functions are supported.  Currently, only exponentials
    and logarithms are supported, but support for trigonometric functions is
    forthcoming.

    If this function returns an unevaluated Integral in the result, it means
    that it has proven that integral to be nonelementary.  Any errors will
    result in raising NotImplementedError.  The unevaluated Integral will be
    an instance of NonElementaryIntegral, a subclass of Integral.

    handle_first may be either 'exp' or 'log'.  This changes the order in
    which the extension is built, and may result in a different (but
    equivalent) solution (for an example of this, see issue 5109).  It is also
    possible that the integral may be computed with one but not the other,
    because not all cases have been implemented yet.  It defaults to 'log' so
    that the outer extension is exponential when possible, because more of the
    exponential case has been implemented.

    If ``separate_integral`` is ``True``, the result is returned as a tuple (ans, i),
    where the integral is ans + i, ans is elementary, and i is either a
    NonElementaryIntegral or 0.  This useful if you want to try further
    integrating the NonElementaryIntegral part using other algorithms to
    possibly get a solution in terms of special functions.  It is False by
    default.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.integrals.risch import risch_integrate
    >>> from sympy import exp, log, pprint
    >>> from sympy.abc import x

    First, we try integrating exp(-x**2). Except for a constant factor of
    2/sqrt(pi), this is the famous error function.

    >>> pprint(risch_integrate(exp(-x**2), x))
      /
     |
     |    2
     |  -x
     | e    dx
     |
    /

    The unevaluated Integral in the result means that risch_integrate() has
    proven that exp(-x**2) does not have an elementary anti-derivative.

    In many cases, risch_integrate() can split out the elementary
    anti-derivative part from the nonelementary anti-derivative part.
    For example,

    >>> pprint(risch_integrate((2*log(x)**2 - log(x) - x**2)/(log(x)**3 -
    ... x**2*log(x)), x))
                                             /
                                            |
      log(-x + log(x))   log(x + log(x))    |   1
    - ---------------- + --------------- +  | ------ dx
             2                  2           | log(x)
                                            |
                                           /

    This means that it has proven that the integral of 1/log(x) is
    nonelementary.  This function is also known as the logarithmic integral,
    and is often denoted as Li(x).

    risch_integrate() currently only accepts purely transcendental functions
    with exponentials and logarithms, though note that this can include
    nested exponentials and logarithms, as well as exponentials with bases
    other than E.

    >>> pprint(risch_integrate(exp(x)*exp(exp(x)), x))
     / x\
     \e /
    e
    >>> pprint(risch_integrate(exp(exp(x)), x))
      /
     |
     |  / x\
     |  \e /
     | e     dx
     |
    /

    >>> pprint(risch_integrate(x*x**x*log(x) + x**x + x*x**x, x))
       x
    x*x
    >>> pprint(risch_integrate(x**x, x))
      /
     |
     |  x
     | x  dx
     |
    /

    >>> pprint(risch_integrate(-1/(x*log(x)*log(log(x))**2), x))
         1
    -----------
    log(log(x))
