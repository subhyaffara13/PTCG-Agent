def trophic_differences(G, weight="weight"):
    r"""Compute the trophic differences of the edges of a directed graph.

    The trophic difference $x_ij$ for each edge is defined in Johnson et al.
    [1]_ as:

    .. math::
        x_ij = s_j - s_i

    Where $s_i$ is the trophic level of node $i$.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : DiGraph
        A directed networkx graph

    Returns
    -------
    diffs : dict
        Dictionary of edges with trophic differences as the value.
