    Forks the RNG, so that when you return, the RNG is reset
    to the state that it was previously in.

    Args:
        devices (iterable of Device IDs): devices for which to fork
            the RNG. CPU RNG state is always forked. By default, :meth:`fork_rng` operates
            on all devices, but will emit a warning if your machine has a lot
            of devices, since this function will run very slowly in that case.
            If you explicitly specify devices, this warning will be suppressed
        enabled (bool): if ``False``, the RNG is not forked.  This is a convenience
            argument for easily disabling the context manager without having
            to delete it and unindent your Python code under it.
        device_type (str): device type str, default is `cuda`. As for supported device,
            see details in :ref:`accelerator<accelerators>`
