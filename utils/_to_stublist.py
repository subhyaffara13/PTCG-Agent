def _to_stublist(degree_sequence):
    """Returns a list of degree-repeated node numbers.

    ``degree_sequence`` is a list of nonnegative integers representing
    the degrees of nodes in a graph.

    This function returns a list of node numbers with multiplicities
    according to the given degree sequence. For example, if the first
    element of ``degree_sequence`` is ``3``, then the first node number,
    ``0``, will appear at the head of the returned list three times. The
    node numbers are assumed to be the numbers zero through
    ``len(degree_sequence) - 1``.

    Examples
    --------

    >>> degree_sequence = [1, 2, 3]
    >>> _to_stublist(degree_sequence)
    [0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2]

    If a zero appears in the sequence, that means the node exists but
    has degree zero, so that number will be skipped in the returned
    list::

    >>> degree_sequence = [2, 0, 1]
    >>> _to_stublist(degree_sequence)
    [0, 0, 2]

    """
    return list(chaini([n] * d for n, d in enumerate(degree_sequence)))
