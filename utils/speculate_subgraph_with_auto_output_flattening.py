    Speculate subgraph for Higher-Order Operators (HOPs) with automatic output flattening.

    ## Automatic output flattening

    For many HOPs, the representation exists only as a container for the
    subgraph. In later compiler stages or at runtime, the HOP is desugared and
    simply executes the subgraph directly, as if it were inlined. For such hops,
    we follow automatic output flattening.
    For example:
    - invoke_subgraph
    - activation checkpointing (torch.utils.checkpoint.checkpoint)
    - autograd.Function
    - nested_compile_region

    This is in contrast to control flow HOPs which do not follow this desugaring:
    - torch.cond (conditional execution based on predicate)
    - torch.while_loop (iterative execution)
    - torch.map (parallel execution over batch dimension)

    For control flow HOPs, the HOP behavior is fundamentally different from just
    running the body function once.

    ## Key Advantage: Disentangling VTs from Graph Outputs

    Desugaring simplify HOP processing by allowing us to disentangle the output
    variable trackers (VTs) from the HOP subgraph outputs. This mirrors typical
    Dynamo processing where:
    - VTs "run ahead" representing the program state for continued tracing
    - The graph is a side data structure tracking computation seen so far

    This separation is crucial for HOPs with non-proxyable outputs (e.g., custom
    user-defined objects containing tensors). The function may return complex Python
    objects for Dynamo to continue tracing, but only the tensor/symint VTs need to
    be registered as actual FX graph outputs.

    Example:
        class Foo:
            def __init__(self, a, b):
                self.a = a  # tensor
                self.b = b  # tensor

        def gn(x):
            return Foo(torch.sin(x), torch.cos(x))

        result = some_hop(gn, x)  # Returns Foo instance
        out = result.a + result.b  # Dynamo can continue tracing

    Here, `output` VT is a UserDefinedObjectVariable wrapping Foo, but
    `graph_output_vts` contains only the tensor VTs (a and b) that should be
    actual FX graph outputs. This allows Dynamo to continue tracing with the
    Foo object while the graph only needs to output the constituent tensors.

    ## Return Values

    Unlike `speculate_subgraph`, this function returns:
    - output: The VT that Dynamo continues tracing with (may be complex Python objects)
    - graph: The FX graph representing the subgraph computation
    - lifted_freevars: Free variables lifted as inputs to the subgraph
    - graph_output_vts: Only the tensor/symint VTs that are actual FX graph outputs

    The key difference is `graph_output_vts` instead of `treespec`, which gives more
    flexibility for handling non-proxyable outputs.
