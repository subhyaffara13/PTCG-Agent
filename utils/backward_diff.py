def backward_diff(tf, sample_per):
    r"""
    Returns falling coefficients of H(z) from numerator and denominator.

    Explanation
    ===========

    Where H(z) is the corresponding discretized transfer function,
    discretized with the backward difference transform method.
    H(z) is obtained from the continuous transfer function H(s)
    by substituting $s(z) =  \frac{z-1}{Tz}$ into H(s), where T is the
    sample period.
    Coefficients are falling, i.e. $H(z) = \frac{az+b}{cz+d}$ is returned
    as [a, b], [c, d].

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.physics.control.lti import TransferFunction, backward_diff
    >>> from sympy.abc import s, L, R, T

    >>> tf = TransferFunction(1, s*L + R, s)
    >>> numZ, denZ = backward_diff(tf, T)
    >>> numZ
    [T/(L + R*T), 0]
    >>> denZ
    [1, -L/(L + R*T)]
