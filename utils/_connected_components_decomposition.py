def _connected_components_decomposition(M):
    """Decomposes a square matrix into block diagonal form only
    using the permutations.

    Explanation
    ===========

    The decomposition is in a form of $A = P^{-1} B P$ where $P$ is a
    permutation matrix and $B$ is a block diagonal matrix.

    Returns
    =======

    P, B : PermutationMatrix, BlockDiagMatrix
        *P* is a permutation matrix for the similarity transform
        as in the explanation. And *B* is the block diagonal matrix of
        the result of the permutation.

        If you would like to get the diagonal blocks from the
        BlockDiagMatrix, see
        :meth:`~sympy.matrices.expressions.blockmatrix.BlockDiagMatrix.get_diag_blocks`.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import Matrix, pprint
    >>> A = Matrix([
    ...     [66, 0, 0, 68, 0, 0, 0, 0, 67],

    ...     [86, 0, 0, 88, 0, 0, 0, 0, 87],
    ...     [0, 0, 10, 0, 11, 12, 0, 0, 0],
    ...     [0, 0, 20, 0, 21, 22, 0, 0, 0],

    Notes
    =====

    This problem corresponds to the finding of the connected components
    of a graph, when a matrix is viewed as a weighted graph.
