    """Returns the Kneser Graph with parameters `n` and `k`.

    The Kneser Graph has nodes that are k-tuples (subsets) of the integers
    between 0 and ``n-1``. Nodes are adjacent if their corresponding sets are disjoint.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n: int
        Number of integers from which to make node subsets.
        Subsets are drawn from ``set(range(n))``.
    k: int
        Size of the subsets.

    Returns
    -------
    G : NetworkX Graph

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.kneser_graph(5, 2)
    >>> G.number_of_nodes()
    10
    >>> G.number_of_edges()
    15
    >>> nx.is_isomorphic(G, nx.petersen_graph())
    True
