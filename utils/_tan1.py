def _tan1(p, x, prec):
    r"""
    Helper function of :func:`rs_tan`.

    Return the series expansion of tan of a univariate series using Newton's
    method. It takes advantage of the fact that series expansion of atan is
    easier than that of tan.

    Consider `f(x) = y - \arctan(x)`
    Let r be a root of f(x) found using Newton's method.
    Then `f(r) = 0`
    Or `y = \arctan(x)` where `x = \tan(y)` as required.
