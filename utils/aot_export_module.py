    This function takes in a module, and returns:
    (1) an FX graph that can be exported
    (2) some metadata about the graph

    If `trace_joint=True` we will return a joint graph of the forward + backward.

    The traced FX graph will have the following properties compared to the original module:
    (1) Inputs and outputs to the module will be pytree-flattened
    (2) Parameters and buffers on the module will be lifted into graph inputs,
        graph_inputs = (*parameters, *buffers, *user_inputs)
    (3) The graph will be fully functionalized
    (4) Any input mutations will be converted into additional outputs in the graph,
        meaning whoever calls this graph is responsible for applying the mutations
        back to the original inputs.
    (5) If is_joint is provided the graph will return parameter gradients in addition to user outputs.
        The graph output will look like:
        graph_outputs = (*updated_inputs, *user_outputs, *param_gradients)

    There are also several restrictions on what modules can use this API. In particular:
    (1) If trace_joint is specified, we expect the loss function to be **fused**
        into the module forward. One of the outputs to the forward must be a scalar loss,
        which is specified with `output_loss_index`.
        All other outputs to the forward are presumed to not require gradients.
    (2) This API cannot capture optimizers (although in theory we could build an API for this).
    (3) Metadata mutations on params/buffers/inputs are banned.
    (4) Data mutations on anything that requires gradients are banned (parameters)
    (5) If an input is mutated, it is not allowed to alias any other inputs.
    (6) Parameters must not be duplicated.
