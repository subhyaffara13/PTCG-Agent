def continued_fraction_reduce(cf):
    """
    Reduce a continued fraction to a rational or quadratic irrational.

    Compute the rational or quadratic irrational number from its
    terminating or periodic continued fraction expansion.  The
    continued fraction expansion (cf) should be supplied as a
    terminating iterator supplying the terms of the expansion.  For
    terminating continued fractions, this is equivalent to
    ``list(continued_fraction_convergents(cf))[-1]``, only a little more
    efficient.  If the expansion has a repeating part, a list of the
    repeating terms should be returned as the last element from the
    iterator.  This is the format returned by
    continued_fraction_periodic.

    For quadratic irrationals, returns the largest solution found,
    which is generally the one sought, if the fraction is in canonical
    form (all terms positive except possibly the first).

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.ntheory.continued_fraction import continued_fraction_reduce
    >>> continued_fraction_reduce([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
    225/157
    >>> continued_fraction_reduce([-2, 1, 9, 7, 1, 2])
    -256/233
    >>> continued_fraction_reduce([2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 8]).n(10)
    2.718281835
    >>> continued_fraction_reduce([1, 4, 2, [3, 1]])
    (sqrt(21) + 287)/238
    >>> continued_fraction_reduce([[1]])
    (1 + sqrt(5))/2
    >>> from sympy.ntheory.continued_fraction import continued_fraction_periodic
    >>> continued_fraction_reduce(continued_fraction_periodic(8, 5, 13))
    (sqrt(13) + 8)/5
