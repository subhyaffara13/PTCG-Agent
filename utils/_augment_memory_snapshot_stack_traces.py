    """
    Augment a memory snapshot with original source stack traces from FX metadata.

    IMPORTANT: This function reads from a global in-memory registry (_FX_METADATA_REGISTRY)
    that is populated during graph module compilation. It must be called in the same
    Python process where the FX graphs were compiled. It cannot be used to augment
    snapshots loaded from disk in a different process.

    Args:
        snapshot (str or _Snapshot): Either a memory snapshot dict or path to a snapshot pickle file

    Returns:
        _Snapshot: The augmented snapshot dictionary with fx_node_op, fx_node_name,
            fx_original_trace, and fx_node_info fields added to frames
