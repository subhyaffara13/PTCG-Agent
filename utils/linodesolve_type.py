def linodesolve_type(A, t, b=None):
    r"""
    Helper function that determines the type of the system of ODEs for solving with :obj:`sympy.solvers.ode.systems.linodesolve()`

    Explanation
    ===========

    This function takes in the coefficient matrix and/or the non-homogeneous term
    and returns the type of the equation that can be solved by :obj:`sympy.solvers.ode.systems.linodesolve()`.

    If the system is constant coefficient homogeneous, then "type1" is returned

    If the system is constant coefficient non-homogeneous, then "type2" is returned

    If the system is non-constant coefficient homogeneous, then "type3" is returned

    If the system is non-constant coefficient non-homogeneous, then "type4" is returned

    If the system has a non-constant coefficient matrix which can be factorized into constant
    coefficient matrix, then "type5" or "type6" is returned for when the system is homogeneous or
    non-homogeneous respectively.

    Note that, if the system of ODEs is of "type3" or "type4", then along with the type,
    the commutative antiderivative of the coefficient matrix is also returned.

    If the system cannot be solved by :obj:`sympy.solvers.ode.systems.linodesolve()`, then
    NotImplementedError is raised.

    Parameters
    ==========

    A : Matrix
        Coefficient matrix of the system of ODEs
    b : Matrix or None
        Non-homogeneous term of the system. The default value is None.
        If this argument is None, then the system is assumed to be homogeneous.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import symbols, Matrix
    >>> from sympy.solvers.ode.systems import linodesolve_type
    >>> t = symbols("t")
    >>> A = Matrix([[1, 1], [2, 3]])
    >>> b = Matrix([t, 1])

    >>> linodesolve_type(A, t)
    {'antiderivative': None, 'type_of_equation': 'type1'}

    >>> linodesolve_type(A, t, b=b)
    {'antiderivative': None, 'type_of_equation': 'type2'}

    >>> A_t = Matrix([[1, t], [-t, 1]])

    >>> linodesolve_type(A_t, t)
    {'antiderivative': Matrix([
    [      t, t**2/2],
    [-t**2/2,      t]]), 'type_of_equation': 'type3'}

    >>> linodesolve_type(A_t, t, b=b)
    {'antiderivative': Matrix([
    [      t, t**2/2],
    [-t**2/2,      t]]), 'type_of_equation': 'type4'}

    >>> A_non_commutative = Matrix([[1, t], [t, -1]])
    >>> linodesolve_type(A_non_commutative, t)
    Traceback (most recent call last):

    NotImplementedError:
    The system does not have a commutative antiderivative, it cannot be
    solved by linodesolve.

    Returns

    Dict

    Raises

        When the coefficient matrix does not have a commutative antiderivative
