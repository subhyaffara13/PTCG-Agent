    """Check if a TypedDict type is overlapping with a Mapping.

    The basic logic here consists of two rules:

    * A TypedDict with some required keys is overlapping with Mapping[str, <some type>]
      if and only if every key type is overlapping with <some type>. For example:

      - TypedDict(x=int, y=str) overlaps with Dict[str, Union[str, int]]
      - TypedDict(x=int, y=str) doesn't overlap with Dict[str, int]

      Note that any additional non-required keys can't change the above result.

    * A TypedDict with no required keys overlaps with Mapping[str, <some type>] if and
      only if at least one of key types overlaps with <some type>. For example:

      - TypedDict(x=str, y=str, total=False) overlaps with Dict[str, str]
      - TypedDict(x=str, y=str, total=False) doesn't overlap with Dict[str, int]
      - TypedDict(x=int, y=str, total=False) overlaps with Dict[str, str]

    * A TypedDict with at least one ReadOnly[] key does not overlap
      with Dict or MutableMapping, because they assume mutable data.

    As usual empty, dictionaries lie in a gray area. In general, List[str] and List[str]
    are considered non-overlapping despite empty list belongs to both. However, List[int]
    and List[Never] are considered overlapping.

    So here we follow the same logic: a TypedDict with no required keys is considered
    non-overlapping with Mapping[str, <some type>], but is considered overlapping with
    Mapping[Never, Never]. This way we avoid false positives for overloads, and also
    avoid false positives for comparisons like SomeTypedDict == {} under --strict-equality.
