    Interleave multiple iterables so that their elements are evenly distributed
    throughout the output sequence.

    >>> iterables = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], ['a', 'b']

    This function requires iterables of known length. Iterables without
    ``__len__()`` can be used by manually specifying lengths with *lengths*:

    >>> from itertools import combinations, repeat
    >>> iterables = [combinations(range(4), 2), ['a', 'b', 'c']]
    >>> lengths = [4 * (4 - 1) // 2, 3]
    >>> list(interleave_evenly(iterables, lengths=lengths))
    [(0, 1), (0, 2), 'a', (0, 3), (1, 2), 'b', (1, 3), (2, 3), 'c']

    Based on Bresenham's algorithm.
