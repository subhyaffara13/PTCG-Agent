    """The parent context for a request-level span (the LLM call, a guardrail).

    These are direct children of the request's root server span — siblings of the
    ``auth`` phase span and of each other, never nested under whatever span is
    momentarily active. So prefer the explicitly anchored root span; fall back to
    ambient context only when there is no anchor (the SDK / no-proxy path), where
    the span legitimately starts its own root trace.

    Unlike :func:`resolve_parent_context` (used by DB/service spans, which DO want
    to nest under the active phase span, e.g. an auth DB lookup under ``auth``),
    this never returns the active span when an anchor exists.
