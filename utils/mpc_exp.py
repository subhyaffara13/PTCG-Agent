    Complex exponential function.

    We use the direct formula exp(a+bi) = exp(a) * (cos(b) + sin(b)*i)
    for the computation. This formula is very nice because it is
    pefectly stable; since we just do real multiplications, the only
    numerical errors that can creep in are single-ulp rounding errors.

    The formula is efficient since mpmath's real exp is quite fast and
    since we can compute cos and sin simultaneously.

    It is no problem if a and b are large; if the implementations of
    exp/cos/sin are accurate and efficient for all real numbers, then
    so is this function for all complex numbers.
