def equivalent(u, v, r, s, D, N):
    """
    Returns True if two solutions `(u, v)` and `(r, s)` of `x^2 - Dy^2 = N`
    belongs to the same equivalence class and False otherwise.

    Explanation
    ===========

    Two solutions `(u, v)` and `(r, s)` to the above equation fall to the same
    equivalence class iff both `(ur - Dvs)` and `(us - vr)` are divisible by
    `N`. See reference [1]_. No test is performed to test whether `(u, v)` and
    `(r, s)` are actually solutions to the equation. User should take care of
    this.

    Usage
    =====

    ``equivalent(u, v, r, s, D, N)``: `(u, v)` and `(r, s)` are two solutions
    of the equation `x^2 - Dy^2 = N` and all parameters involved are integers.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.solvers.diophantine.diophantine import equivalent
    >>> equivalent(18, 5, -18, -5, 13, -1)
    True
    >>> equivalent(3, 1, -18, 393, 109, -4)
    False
