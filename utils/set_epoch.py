def set_epoch(epoch):
    """
    Set the epoch (origin for dates) for datetime calculations.

    The default epoch is :rc:`date.epoch`.

    If microsecond accuracy is desired, the date being plotted needs to be
    within approximately 70 years of the epoch. Matplotlib internally
    represents dates as days since the epoch, so floating point dynamic
    range needs to be within a factor of 2^52.

    `~.dates.set_epoch` must be called before any dates are converted
    (i.e. near the import section) or a RuntimeError will be raised.

    See also :doc:`/gallery/ticks/date_precision_and_epochs`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    epoch : str
        valid UTC date parsable by `numpy.datetime64` (do not include
        timezone).
