def get_basis(expr, *, basis=None, replace_none=True, **options):
    """
    Returns a basis state instance corresponding to the basis specified in
    options=s. If no basis is specified, the function tries to form a default
    basis state of the given expression.

    There are three behaviors:

    1. The basis specified in options is already an instance of StateBase. If
       this is the case, it is simply returned. If the class is specified but
       not an instance, a default instance is returned.

    2. The basis specified is an operator or set of operators. If this
       is the case, the operator_to_state mapping method is used.

    3. No basis is specified. If expr is a state, then a default instance of
       its class is returned.  If expr is an operator, then it is mapped to the
       corresponding state.  If it is neither, then we cannot obtain the basis
       state.

    If the basis cannot be mapped, then it is not changed.

    This will be called from within represent, and represent will
    only pass QExpr's.

    TODO (?): Support for Muls and other types of expressions?

    Parameters
    ==========

    expr : Operator or StateBase
        Expression whose basis is sought
