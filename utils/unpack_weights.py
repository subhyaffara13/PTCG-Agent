def unpack_weights(packed: torch.Tensor, dtype: torch.dtype) -> torch.Tensor:
    """
    Unpacks a tensor of quantized weights that were stored in a packed format using 2 bits per value.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    packed : torch.Tensor
        A tensor containing packed weights where each element represents 4 quantized values (using 2 bits per value).
    dtype : torch.dtype
        The dtype of the returned Tensor
    Returns:
    --------
    torch.Tensor
        A tensor of unpacked weights, where each value is converted from its packed 2-bit representation.

    Example:
    --------
    packed = torch.tensor([[0b10100001, 0b00011000],
                           [0b10010000, 0b00001010]], dtype=torch.uint8)

    # Unpack the values
    unpacked = unpack_weights(packed)

    # Resulting unpacked tensor
    print(unpacked)
    # Output: tensor([[ 0, -1],
                      [-1,  1],
                      [-1,  1],
                      [-1,  1],
                      [ 1,  0],
                      [ 0, -1],
                      [ 1, -1],
                      [ 1, -1]])

    Explanation of the example:
    ---------------------------
    Let's take the first value for example 0b10100001, we will only focus on the first column,
    because every element is unpacked across the first dimension
    - First 2 bits: `01` → 0 at [0][0]
    - Second 2 bits: `00` → -1 at [0][2]
    - Third 2 bits: `10` → 1 at [0][4]
    - Fourth 2 bits: `10` → 1 at [0][6]
    the second value of the same row (0b10010000) will give the values for [0][1], [0][3], [0][5], [0][7]

    We subtract 1 because during the packing process, it's easier to work with values like 0, 1, and 2. To make this possible,
    we add 1 to the original ternary weights (which are typically -1, 0, and 1) when packing them. When unpacking, we reverse
    this by subtracting 1 to restore the original ternary values.
