    Validate the args↔grads contract for static mode.

    Enforces four rules for each (arg, grad) pair:
      1. len(args) must equal len(grads).
      2. If arg.requires_grad is False, grad must be None.
      3. If arg.requires_grad is True and grad is None, emit a warning
         (this is legal at pipeline boundaries but may indicate a bug).
      4. If arg is a DTensor with requires_grad=True and grad is not None,
         grad must also be a DTensor.

    Args:
        stage_index: The stage index for error messages.
        args: Tuple of forward tensors.
        grads: Tuple of gradient tensors (can include None).
        is_input: True for input_args/input_grads, False for output_args/output_grads.

    Raises:
        PipeliningMetadataError: If any hard rule (1, 2, or 4) is violated.
