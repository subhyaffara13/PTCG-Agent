    OpenType table version numbers are expressed as a single unsigned long

    version. This function detects if the value to be used as a version number
    looks too small (i.e. is less than ``0x10000``), and converts it to
    fixed-point using :func:`floatToFixed` if so.

    Args:
            value (Number): a candidate table version number.

    Returns:
            int: A table version number, possibly corrected to fixed-point.
