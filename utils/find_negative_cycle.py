def find_negative_cycle(G, source, weight="weight"):
    """Returns a cycle with negative total weight if it exists.

    Bellman-Ford is used to find shortest_paths. That algorithm
    stops if there exists a negative cycle. This algorithm
    picks up from there and returns the found negative cycle.

    The cycle consists of a list of nodes in the cycle order. The last
    node equals the first to make it a cycle.
    You can look up the edge weights in the original graph. In the case
    of multigraphs the relevant edge is the minimal weight edge between
    the nodes in the 2-tuple.

    If the graph has no negative cycle, a NetworkXError is raised.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    source: node label
        The search for the negative cycle will start from this node.

    weight : string or function
        If this is a string, then edge weights will be accessed via the
        edge attribute with this key (that is, the weight of the edge
        joining `u` to `v` will be ``G.edges[u, v][weight]``). If no
        such edge attribute exists, the weight of the edge is assumed to
        be one.

        If this is a function, the weight of an edge is the value
        returned by the function. The function must accept exactly three
        positional arguments: the two endpoints of an edge and the
        dictionary of edge attributes for that edge. The function must
        return a number.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.DiGraph()
    >>> G.add_weighted_edges_from(
    ...     [(0, 1, 2), (1, 2, 2), (2, 0, 1), (1, 4, 2), (4, 0, -5)]
    ... )
    >>> nx.find_negative_cycle(G, 0)
    [4, 0, 1, 4]

    Returns
    -------
    cycle : list
        A list of nodes in the order of the cycle found. The last node
        equals the first to indicate a cycle.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        If no negative cycle is found.
