    However, MSYS2 incorrectly patches sysconfig ``nt`` scheme. The fix is
    likely going to be included in their 3.10 release, so we ignore the warning.
    See msys2/MINGW-packages#9319.

    MSYS2 MINGW's patch uses lowercase ``"lib"`` instead of the usual uppercase,
    and is missing the final ``"site-packages"``.
