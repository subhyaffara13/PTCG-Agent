def multiset_partitions(multiset, m=None):
    """
    Return unique partitions of the given multiset (in list form).
    If ``m`` is None, all multisets will be returned, otherwise only
    partitions with ``m`` parts will be returned.

    If ``multiset`` is an integer, a range [0, 1, ..., multiset - 1]
    will be supplied.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.utilities.iterables import multiset_partitions
    >>> list(multiset_partitions([1, 2, 3, 4], 2))
    [[[1, 2, 3], [4]], [[1, 2, 4], [3]], [[1, 2], [3, 4]],
    [[1, 3, 4], [2]], [[1, 3], [2, 4]], [[1, 4], [2, 3]],
    [[1], [2, 3, 4]]]
    >>> list(multiset_partitions([1, 2, 3, 4], 1))
    [[[1, 2, 3, 4]]]

    Only unique partitions are returned and these will be returned in a
    canonical order regardless of the order of the input:

    >>> a = [1, 2, 2, 1]
    >>> ans = list(multiset_partitions(a, 2))
    >>> a.sort()
    >>> list(multiset_partitions(a, 2)) == ans
    True
    >>> a = range(3, 1, -1)
    >>> (list(multiset_partitions(a)) ==
    ...  list(multiset_partitions(sorted(a))))
    True

    If m is omitted then all partitions will be returned:

    >>> list(multiset_partitions([1, 1, 2]))
    [[[1, 1, 2]], [[1, 1], [2]], [[1, 2], [1]], [[1], [1], [2]]]
    >>> list(multiset_partitions([1]*3))
    [[[1, 1, 1]], [[1], [1, 1]], [[1], [1], [1]]]

    Counting
    ========

    The number of partitions of a set is given by the bell number:

    >>> from sympy import bell
    >>> len(list(multiset_partitions(5))) == bell(5) == 52
    True

    The number of partitions of length k from a set of size n is given by the
    Stirling Number of the 2nd kind:

    >>> from sympy.functions.combinatorial.numbers import stirling
    >>> stirling(5, 2) == len(list(multiset_partitions(5, 2))) == 15
    True

    These comments on counting apply to *sets*, not multisets.

    Notes
    =====

    When all the elements are the same in the multiset, the order
    of the returned partitions is determined by the ``partitions``
    routine. If one is counting partitions then it is better to use
    the ``nT`` function.
