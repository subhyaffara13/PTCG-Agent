def savez(file, *args, allow_pickle=True, **kwds):
    """Save several arrays into a single file in uncompressed ``.npz`` format.

    Provide arrays as keyword arguments to store them under the
    corresponding name in the output file: ``savez(fn, x=x, y=y)``.

    If arrays are specified as positional arguments, i.e., ``savez(fn,
    x, y)``, their names will be `arr_0`, `arr_1`, etc.

    Parameters
    ----------
    file : file, str, or pathlib.Path
        Either the filename (string) or an open file (file-like object)
        where the data will be saved. If file is a string or a Path, the
        ``.npz`` extension will be appended to the filename if it is not
        already there.
    args : Arguments, optional
        Arrays to save to the file. Please use keyword arguments (see
        `kwds` below) to assign names to arrays.  Arrays specified as
        args will be named "arr_0", "arr_1", and so on.
    allow_pickle : bool, optional
        Allow saving object arrays using Python pickles. Reasons for
        disallowing pickles include security (loading pickled data can execute
        arbitrary code) and portability (pickled objects may not be loadable
        on different Python installations, for example if the stored objects
        require libraries that are not available, and not all pickled data is
        compatible between different versions of Python).
        Default: True
    kwds : Keyword arguments, optional
        Arrays to save to the file. Each array will be saved to the
        output file with its corresponding keyword name.

    Returns
    -------
    None

    See Also
    --------
    save : Save a single array to a binary file in NumPy format.
    savetxt : Save an array to a file as plain text.
    savez_compressed : Save several arrays into a compressed ``.npz`` archive

    Notes
    -----
    The ``.npz`` file format is a zipped archive of files named after the
    variables they contain.  The archive is not compressed and each file
    in the archive contains one variable in ``.npy`` format. For a
    description of the ``.npy`` format, see :py:mod:`numpy.lib.format`.

    When opening the saved ``.npz`` file with `load` a `~lib.npyio.NpzFile`
    object is returned. This is a dictionary-like object which can be queried
    for its list of arrays (with the ``.files`` attribute), and for the arrays
    themselves.

    Keys passed in `kwds` are used as filenames inside the ZIP archive.
    Therefore, keys should be valid filenames; e.g., avoid keys that begin with
    ``/`` or contain ``.``.

    When naming variables with keyword arguments, it is not possible to name a
    variable ``file``, as this would cause the ``file`` argument to be defined
    twice in the call to ``savez``.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from tempfile import TemporaryFile
    >>> outfile = TemporaryFile()
    >>> x = np.arange(10)
    >>> y = np.sin(x)

    Using `savez` with \\*args, the arrays are saved with default names.

    >>> np.savez(outfile, x, y)
    >>> _ = outfile.seek(0) # Only needed to simulate closing & reopening file
    >>> npzfile = np.load(outfile)
    >>> npzfile.files
    ['arr_0', 'arr_1']
    >>> npzfile['arr_0']
    array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])

    Using `savez` with \\**kwds, the arrays are saved with the keyword names.

    >>> outfile = TemporaryFile()
    >>> np.savez(outfile, x=x, y=y)
    >>> _ = outfile.seek(0)
    >>> npzfile = np.load(outfile)
    >>> sorted(npzfile.files)
    ['x', 'y']
    >>> npzfile['x']
    array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
