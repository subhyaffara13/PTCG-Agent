def _rational_reconstruction_int_coeffs(hm, m, ring):
    r"""
    Reconstruct every rational coefficient `c_h` of a polynomial `h` in
    `\mathbb Q[t_1, \ldots, t_k][x, z]` from the corresponding integer
    coefficient `c_{h_m}` of a polynomial `h_m` in
    `\mathbb Z[t_1, \ldots, t_k][x, z]` such that

    .. math::

        c_{h_m} = c_h \; \mathrm{mod} \, m,

    where `m \in \mathbb Z`.

    The reconstruction is based on the Euclidean Algorithm. In general,
    `m` is not a prime number, so it is possible that this fails for some
    coefficient. In that case ``None`` is returned.

    Parameters
    ==========

    hm : PolyElement
        polynomial in `\mathbb Z[t_1, \ldots, t_k][x, z]`
    m : Integer
        modulus, not necessarily prime
    ring : PolyRing
        `\mathbb Q[t_1, \ldots, t_k][x, z]`, `h` will be an element of this
        ring

    Returns
    =======

    h : PolyElement
        reconstructed polynomial in `\mathbb Q[t_1, \ldots, t_k][x, z]` or
        ``None``
