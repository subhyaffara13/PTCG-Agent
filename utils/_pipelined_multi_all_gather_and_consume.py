    # Parallelization strategy: after each rank copies its shard into its local
    # p2p buffer, every rank issues independent p2p copy -> shard_consumer
    # sequences to two streams. In addition to computation/communication
    # overlapping, the strategy allows for computation/computation overlapping,
    # greatly reducing quantization inefficiency.
    #
    # Notation:
    # - "mv" for the copy to local buffer
    # - "cp" for p2p copies
    # - "b" for barriers
    #
    # Constraints:
    # - The GPU scheduler may or may not overlap "mv" with the first shard_consumer.
    # - "cp" from different streams cannot overlap.
    #
    # Ideal scenario 0 - "mv" overlaps with the first shard_consumer:
    #
    # stream 0: [ shard_consumer ][ cp ][ shard_consumer ]
    # stream 1: [ mv ][b][ cp ][ shard_consumer ]
    #
    # Ideal scenario 1 - "mv" is scheduled before the first shard_consumer:
    #
    # stream 0:       [ shard_consumer ][ cp ][ shard_consumer ]
    # stream 1: [ mv ][b][ cp ][ shard_consumer ]
    #
    # Suboptimal scenario 0 - "mv" is scheduled after the first shard_consumer:
    #
    # stream 0: [ shard_consumer ]               [ cp ][ shard_consumer ]
    # stream 1:                   [ mv ][b][ cp ][ shard_consumer ]

    # and "b" with the first shard_consumer for now.
