def potential_energy(*body):
    """Potential energy of a multibody system.

    Explanation
    ===========

    This function returns the potential energy of a system of Particle's and/or
    RigidBody's. The potential energy of such a system is equal to the sum of
    the potential energy of its constituents. Consider a system, S, comprising
    a rigid body, A, and a particle, P. The potential energy of the system, V,
    is equal to the vector sum of the potential energy of the particle, V1, and
    the potential energy of the rigid body, V2, i.e.

    V = V1 + V2

    Potential energy is a scalar.

    Parameters
    ==========

    body1, body2, body3... : Particle and/or RigidBody
        The body (or bodies) whose potential energy is required.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.physics.mechanics import Point, Particle, ReferenceFrame
    >>> from sympy.physics.mechanics import RigidBody, outer, potential_energy
    >>> from sympy import symbols
    >>> M, m, g, h = symbols('M m g h')
    >>> N = ReferenceFrame('N')
    >>> O = Point('O')
    >>> O.set_vel(N, 0 * N.x)
    >>> P = O.locatenew('P', 1 * N.x)
    >>> Pa = Particle('Pa', P, m)
    >>> Ac = O.locatenew('Ac', 2 * N.y)
    >>> a = ReferenceFrame('a')
    >>> I = outer(N.z, N.z)
    >>> A = RigidBody('A', Ac, a, M, (I, Ac))
    >>> Pa.potential_energy = m * g * h
    >>> A.potential_energy = M * g * h
    >>> potential_energy(Pa, A)
    M*g*h + g*h*m
