    We build a mapping from the keys obtained by renaming each of the checkpoint keys according to the weight_mapping rules.
    Then we load the tensors into the model, applying any conversion operations as needed.

    The `param_name_to_load` will look like this:
    {
        "model.layers.0.attention.q.weight": # Notice here there is only the first key of the target keys
            WeightConverter(
                source_patterns=["qkv"],
                target_patterns=["q", "k","v"],
                operations=[Chunk(dim=0, chunks=3)]),
                collected_tensors={
                    "qkv": [Future]},
                layer_targets={
                    "model.layers.0.attention.q.weight": {"model.layers.0.attention.qkv.weight"},
                    "model.layers.0.attention.k.weight": {"model.layers.0.attention.qkv.weight"},
                    "model.layers.0.attention.v.weight": {"model.layers.0.attention.qkv.weight"},
                }
            ),
        ...
    }

    We make sure that the keys are the full keys. The only "nit" here is that 1 key can map to multiple target keys (e.g. qkv -> q, k, v).
    In that case the weight converter will take care of doing the appropriate renaming.

    For example for:
    ```python
    WeightConverter(
        source_patterns=["mlp.experts.*.gate_proj.weight","mlp.experts.*.up_proj.weight"],
        target_patterns="mlp.experts.gate_up_proj",
        operations=[MergeModulelist(dim=0), Concatenate(dim=1)],
    )
    ```
    we would have the following collected tensors:
    ```python
    collected_tensors = {
        "mlp.experts.*.gate_proj.weight": [Future, Future, Future, Future, Future, Future, Future, Future],
        "mlp.experts.*.up_proj.weight": [Future, Future, Future, Future, Future, Future, Future, Future],
    }
    ```
    The first op, `MergeModulelist`, would stack the 8 tensors of each source but will not "rename" them into the fused target name.
    The second op, `Concatenate`, would then rename the fused tensor into the final target name.

    If we want to split `qkv` we would have:
    ```python
    collected_tensors = {
        "attention.qkv.weight": [Future], # here its the full SOURCE keys.
    }
    ```
    The `Chunk` operation would then split the single tensor into 3 and rename them accordingly and update the collected tensors to:
    ```python
    realized_values = {
        "attention.q.weight": [Tensor],
        "attention.k.weight": [Tensor],
        "attention.v.weight": [Tensor],
    }
    ```

    Now that this is done, we can quantize / dequantize accordingly the collected_tensors.

    For some quantization methods, we need to gather different tensors:

    ```python
    # for "medmekk/llama-3.2-1b-float8-torchao"
    WeightConverter(
        source_patterns=[":qdata", ":scale"],
        target_patterns="",
        operations=[TorchaoDeserialize()],
    )
    ```
    This will collect all tensors that have the same prefix, but end with `:qdata` or `:scale`. This will give us:
    ```python
    all_weight_mapping = {
        "model.layers.13.self_attn.o_proj.weight": WeightConverter(
            source_patterns=[":qdata", ":scale"],
            target_patterns="",
            operations=[TorchaoDeserialize()],
            collected_tensors={
                ":qdata": [Future],
                ":scale": [Future],
            },
        ...
    }
    ```
