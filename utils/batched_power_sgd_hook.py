    Implement simplified PowerSGD algorithm.

    This DDP communication hook implements a simplified PowerSGD gradient compression
    algorithm described in the `paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13727>`_.
    This variant does not compress the gradients layer by layer,
    but instead compresses the flattened input tensor that batches all the gradients.
    Therefore, it is **faster** than :meth:`powerSGD_hook`,
    but usually results in a **much lower accuracy**, unless ``matrix_approximation_rank`` is 1.

    .. warning ::
        Increasing ``matrix_approximation_rank`` here may not necessarily increase the accuracy,
        because batching per-parameter tensors without column/row alignment can destroy low-rank structure.
        Therefore, the user should always consider :meth:`powerSGD_hook` first,
        and only consider this variant when a satisfactory accuracy can be achieved when ``matrix_approximation_rank`` is 1.

    Once gradient tensors are aggregated across all workers, this hook applies
    compression as follows:

    1. Views the input flattened 1D gradient tensor as a square-shaped tensor M with 0 paddings;

    2. Creates two low-rank tensors P and Q for decomposing M, such that M = PQ^T, where Q is initialized from a standard normal distribution and orthogonalized;

    3. Computes P, which is equal to MQ;

    4. Allreduces P;

    5. Orthogonalizes P;

    6. Computes Q, which is approximately equal to M^TP;

    7. Allreduces Q;

    8. Computes M, which is approximately equal to PQ^T.

    9. Truncates the input tensor to the original length.

    Note that this communication hook enforces vanilla allreduce for the first ``state.start_powerSGD_iter`` iterations.
    This not only gives the user more control over the tradeoff between speedup and accuracy,
    but also helps abstract away some complexity of the internal optimization of DDP for future communication hook developers.

    Args:
        state (PowerSGDState): State information to configure the compression rate and support error feedback, warm start, etc.
            To tune the compression configs, mainly need to tune ``matrix_approximation_rank`` and ``start_powerSGD_iter``.
        bucket (dist.GradBucket): Bucket that stores a 1D flattened gradient tensor that batches multiple per-variable tensors.
            Note that since DDP comm hook only supports single process single device mode,
            only exactly one tensor is stored in this bucket.

    Returns:
        Future handler of the communication, which updates the gradients in place.
