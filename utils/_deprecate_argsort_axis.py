    Adjust the axis passed to argsort, warning if necessary

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr
        The array which argsort was called on

    np.ma.argsort has a long-term bug where the default of the axis argument
    is wrong (gh-8701), which now must be kept for backwards compatibility.
    Thankfully, this only makes a difference when arrays are 2- or more-
    dimensional, so we only need a warning then.

        # subclasses, which are more likely to implement scalar axes.
