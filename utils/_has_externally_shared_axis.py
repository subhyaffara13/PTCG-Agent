def _has_externally_shared_axis(ax1: Axes, compare_axis: str) -> bool:
    """
    Return whether an axis is externally shared.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ax1 : matplotlib.axes.Axes
        Axis to query.
    compare_axis : str
        `"x"` or `"y"` according to whether the X-axis or Y-axis is being
        compared.

    Returns
    -------
    bool
        `True` if the axis is externally shared. Otherwise `False`.

    Notes
    -----
    If two axes with different positions are sharing an axis, they can be
    referred to as *externally* sharing the common axis.

    If two axes sharing an axis also have the same position, they can be
    referred to as *internally* sharing the common axis (a.k.a twinning).

    _handle_shared_axes() is only interested in axes externally sharing an
    axis, regardless of whether either of the axes is also internally sharing
    with a third axis.
