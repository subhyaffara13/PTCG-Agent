    """
    Probability density of a random expression, optionally given a second
    condition.

    Explanation
    ===========

    This density will take on different forms for different types of
    probability spaces. Discrete variables produce Dicts. Continuous
    variables produce Lambdas.

    Parameters
    ==========

    expr : Expr containing RandomSymbols
        The expression of which you want to compute the density value
    condition : Relational containing RandomSymbols
        A conditional expression. density(X > 1, X > 0) is density of X > 1
        given X > 0
    numsamples : int
        Enables sampling and approximates the density with this many samples

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.stats import density, Die, Normal
    >>> from sympy import Symbol

    >>> x = Symbol('x')
    >>> D = Die('D', 6)
    >>> X = Normal(x, 0, 1)

    >>> density(D).dict
    {1: 1/6, 2: 1/6, 3: 1/6, 4: 1/6, 5: 1/6, 6: 1/6}

    {2: 1/6, 4: 1/6, 6: 1/6, 8: 1/6, 10: 1/6, 12: 1/6}

    Notes
    -----
    The density is 0 for a graph without edges and 1 for a complete graph.
    The density of multigraphs can be higher than 1.

    Self loops are counted in the total number of edges so graphs with self
    loops can have density higher than 1.

    Parameters
    ----------

    nodes: list or container
      Nodes in one node set of the bipartite graph.

    Returns
    -------
    d : float
       The bipartite density

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from networkx.algorithms import bipartite
    >>> G = nx.complete_bipartite_graph(3, 2)

    >>> bipartite.density(G, X)

    1.0

    Notes
    -----
    The container of nodes passed as argument must contain all nodes
    in one of the two bipartite node sets to avoid ambiguity in the
    case of disconnected graphs.
    See :mod:`bipartite documentation <networkx.algorithms.bipartite>`
