def corona_product(G, H):
    r"""Returns the Corona product of G and H.

    The corona product of $G$ and $H$ is the graph $C = G \circ H$ obtained by
    taking one copy of $G$, called the center graph, $|V(G)|$ copies of $H$,
    called the outer graph, and making the $i$-th vertex of $G$ adjacent to
    every vertex of the $i$-th copy of $H$, where $1 ≤ i ≤ |V(G)|$.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G, H: NetworkX graphs
        The graphs to take the carona product of.
        `G` is the center graph and `H` is the outer graph

    Returns
    -------
    C: NetworkX graph
        The Corona product of G and H.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        If G and H are not both directed or both undirected.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.cycle_graph(4)
    >>> H = nx.path_graph(2)
    >>> C = nx.corona_product(G, H)
    >>> list(C)
    [0, 1, 2, 3, (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1)]
    >>> print(C)
    Graph with 12 nodes and 16 edges
