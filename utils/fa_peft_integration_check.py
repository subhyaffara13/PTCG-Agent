    PEFT usually casts the layer norms in float32 for training stability reasons
    therefore the input hidden states gets silently casted in float32. Hence, we need
    cast them back in float16 / bfloat16 just to be sure everything works as expected.
    This might slowdown training & inference so it is recommended to not cast the LayerNorms!
