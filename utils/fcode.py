    """Converts an expr to a string of fortran code

    Parameters
    ==========

    expr : Expr
        A SymPy expression to be converted.
    assign_to : optional
        When given, the argument is used as the name of the variable to which
        the expression is assigned. Can be a string, ``Symbol``,
        ``MatrixSymbol``, or ``Indexed`` type. This is helpful in case of
        line-wrapping, or for expressions that generate multi-line statements.
    precision : integer, optional
        DEPRECATED. Use type_mappings instead. The precision for numbers such
        as pi [default=17].
    user_functions : dict, optional
        A dictionary where keys are ``FunctionClass`` instances and values are
        their string representations. Alternatively, the dictionary value can
        be a list of tuples i.e. [(argument_test, cfunction_string)]. See below
        for examples.
    human : bool, optional
        If True, the result is a single string that may contain some constant
        declarations for the number symbols. If False, the same information is
        returned in a tuple of (symbols_to_declare, not_supported_functions,
        code_text). [default=True].
    contract: bool, optional
        If True, ``Indexed`` instances are assumed to obey tensor contraction
        rules and the corresponding nested loops over indices are generated.
        Setting contract=False will not generate loops, instead the user is
        responsible to provide values for the indices in the code.
        [default=True].
    source_format : optional
        The source format can be either 'fixed' or 'free'. [default='fixed']
    standard : integer, optional
        The Fortran standard to be followed. This is specified as an integer.
        Acceptable standards are 66, 77, 90, 95, 2003, and 2008. Default is 77.
        Note that currently the only distinction internally is between
        standards before 95, and those 95 and after. This may change later as
        more features are added.
    name_mangling : bool, optional
        If True, then the variables that would become identical in
        case-insensitive Fortran are mangled by appending different number
        of ``_`` at the end. If False, SymPy Will not interfere with naming of
        variables. [default=True]

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import fcode, symbols, Rational, sin, ceiling, floor
    >>> x, tau = symbols("x, tau")
    >>> fcode((2*tau)**Rational(7, 2))
    '      8*sqrt(2.0d0)*tau**(7.0d0/2.0d0)'
    >>> fcode(sin(x), assign_to="s")
    '      s = sin(x)'

    Custom printing can be defined for certain types by passing a dictionary of
    "type" : "function" to the ``user_functions`` kwarg. Alternatively, the
    dictionary value can be a list of tuples i.e. [(argument_test,
    cfunction_string)].

    >>> custom_functions = {
    ...   "ceiling": "CEIL",
    ...   "floor": [(lambda x: not x.is_integer, "FLOOR1"),
    ...             (lambda x: x.is_integer, "FLOOR2")]
    ... }
    >>> fcode(floor(x) + ceiling(x), user_functions=custom_functions)
    '      CEIL(x) + FLOOR1(x)'

    ``Piecewise`` expressions are converted into conditionals. If an
    ``assign_to`` variable is provided an if statement is created, otherwise
    the ternary operator is used. Note that if the ``Piecewise`` lacks a
    default term, represented by ``(expr, True)`` then an error will be thrown.
    This is to prevent generating an expression that may not evaluate to
    anything.

    >>> from sympy import Piecewise
    >>> expr = Piecewise((x + 1, x > 0), (x, True))
    >>> print(fcode(expr, tau))
          if (x > 0) then
             tau = x + 1
          else
             tau = x
          end if

    Support for loops is provided through ``Indexed`` types. With
    ``contract=True`` these expressions will be turned into loops, whereas
    ``contract=False`` will just print the assignment expression that should be
    looped over:

    >>> from sympy import Eq, IndexedBase, Idx
    >>> len_y = 5
    >>> y = IndexedBase('y', shape=(len_y,))
    >>> t = IndexedBase('t', shape=(len_y,))
    >>> Dy = IndexedBase('Dy', shape=(len_y-1,))
    >>> i = Idx('i', len_y-1)
    >>> e=Eq(Dy[i], (y[i+1]-y[i])/(t[i+1]-t[i]))
    >>> fcode(e.rhs, assign_to=e.lhs, contract=False)
    '      Dy(i) = (y(i + 1) - y(i))/(t(i + 1) - t(i))'

    Matrices are also supported, but a ``MatrixSymbol`` of the same dimensions
    must be provided to ``assign_to``. Note that any expression that can be
    generated normally can also exist inside a Matrix:

    >>> from sympy import Matrix, MatrixSymbol
    >>> mat = Matrix([x**2, Piecewise((x + 1, x > 0), (x, True)), sin(x)])
    >>> A = MatrixSymbol('A', 3, 1)
    >>> print(fcode(mat, A))
          A(1, 1) = x**2
             if (x > 0) then
          A(2, 1) = x + 1
             else
          A(2, 1) = x
             end if
          A(3, 1) = sin(x)
