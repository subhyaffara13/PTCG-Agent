def lcim(numbers):
    """Returns the least common integral multiple of a list of numbers.

    The numbers can be rational or irrational or a mixture of both.
    `None` is returned for incommensurable numbers.

    Parameters
    ==========

    numbers : list
        Numbers (rational and/or irrational) for which lcim is to be found.

    Returns
    =======

    number
        lcim if it exists, otherwise ``None`` for incommensurable numbers.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import S, pi
    >>> lcim([S(1)/2, S(3)/4, S(5)/6])
    15/2
    >>> lcim([2*pi, 3*pi, pi, pi/2])
