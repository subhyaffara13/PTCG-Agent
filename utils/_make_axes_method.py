    Patch the qualname for functions that are directly added to Axes.

    Some Axes functionality is defined in functions in other submodules.
    These are simply added as attributes to Axes. As a result, their
    ``__qualname__`` is e.g. only "table" and not "Axes.table". This
    function fixes that.

    Note that the function itself is patched, so that
    ``matplotlib.table.table.__qualname__` will also show "Axes.table".
    However, since these functions are not intended to be standalone,
    this is bearable.
