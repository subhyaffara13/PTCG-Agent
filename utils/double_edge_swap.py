def double_edge_swap(G, nswap=1, max_tries=100, seed=None):
    """Swap two edges in the graph while keeping the node degrees fixed.

    A double-edge swap removes two randomly chosen edges u-v and x-y
    and creates the new edges u-x and v-y::

     u--v            u  v
            becomes  |  |
     x--y            x  y

    If either the edge u-x or v-y already exist no swap is performed
    and another attempt is made to find a suitable edge pair.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
       An undirected graph

    nswap : integer (optional, default=1)
       Number of double-edge swaps to perform

    max_tries : integer (optional)
       Maximum number of attempts to swap edges

    seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
        Indicator of random number generation state.
        See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.

    Returns
    -------
    G : graph
       The graph after double edge swaps.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        If `G` is directed, or
        If `nswap` > `max_tries`, or
        If there are fewer than 4 nodes or 2 edges in `G`.
    NetworkXAlgorithmError
        If the number of swap attempts exceeds `max_tries` before `nswap` swaps are made

    Notes
    -----
    Does not enforce any connectivity constraints.

    The graph G is modified in place.
