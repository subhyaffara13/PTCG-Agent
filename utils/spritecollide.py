    Return a list containing all Sprites in a Group that intersect with another
    Sprite. Intersection is determined by comparing the Sprite.rect attribute
    of each Sprite.

    The dokill argument is a bool. If set to True, all Sprites that collide
    will be removed from the Group.

    The collided argument is a callback function used to calculate if two
    sprites are colliding. it should take two sprites as values, and return a
    bool value indicating if they are colliding. If collided is not passed, all
    sprites must have a "rect" value, which is a rectangle of the sprite area,
    which will be used to calculate the collision.
