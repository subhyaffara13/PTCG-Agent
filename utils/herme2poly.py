def herme2poly(c):
    """
    Convert a Hermite series to a polynomial.

    Convert an array representing the coefficients of a Hermite series,
    ordered from lowest degree to highest, to an array of the coefficients
    of the equivalent polynomial (relative to the "standard" basis) ordered
    from lowest to highest degree.

    Parameters
    ----------
    c : array_like
        1-D array containing the Hermite series coefficients, ordered
        from lowest order term to highest.

    Returns
    -------
    pol : ndarray
        1-D array containing the coefficients of the equivalent polynomial
        (relative to the "standard" basis) ordered from lowest order term
        to highest.

    See Also
    --------
    poly2herme

    Notes
    -----
    The easy way to do conversions between polynomial basis sets
    is to use the convert method of a class instance.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from numpy.polynomial.hermite_e import herme2poly
    >>> herme2poly([  2.,  10.,   2.,   3.])
    array([0.,  1.,  2.,  3.])
