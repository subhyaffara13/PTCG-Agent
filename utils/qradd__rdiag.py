def qradd_Rdiag(c, Q, Rdiag, n):
    '''
    This function updates the QR factorization of an MxN matrix A of full column rank, attempting to
    add a new column C to this matrix as the LAST column while maintaining the full-rankness.
    Case 1. If C is not in range(A) (theoretically, it implies N < M), then the new matrix is np.hstack([A, C])
    Case 2. If C is in range(A), then the new matrix is np.hstack([A[:, :n-1], C])
    N.B.:
    0. Instead of R, this subroutine updates Rdiag, which is np.diag(R), with a size at most M and at
    least min(m, n+1). The number is min(m, n+1) rather than min(m, n) as n may be augmented by 1 in
    the function.
    1. With the two cases specified as above, this function does not need A as an input.
    2. The function changes only Q[:, nsave:m] (nsave is the original value of n) and
    R[:, n-1] (n takes the updated value)
    3. Indeed, when C is in range(A), Powell wrote in comments that "set iOUT to the index of the
    constraint (here, column of A --- Zaikun) to be deleted, but branch if no suitable index can be
    found". The idea is to replace a column of A by C so that the new matrix still has full rank
    (such a column must exist unless C = 0). But his code essentially sets iout=n always. Maybe he
    found this worked well enough in practice. Meanwhile, Powell's code includes a snippet that can
    never be reached, which was probably intended to deal with the case that IOUT != n
