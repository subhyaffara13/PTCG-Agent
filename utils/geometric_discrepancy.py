        method: Literal["mindist", "mst"] = "mindist",
        metric: str = "euclidean") -> float:
    """Discrepancy of a given sample based on its geometric properties.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sample : array_like (n, d)
        The sample to compute the discrepancy from.
    method : {"mindist", "mst"}, optional
        The method to use. One of ``mindist`` for minimum distance (default)
        or ``mst`` for minimum spanning tree.
    metric : str or callable, optional
        The distance metric to use. See the documentation
        for `scipy.spatial.distance.pdist` for the available metrics and
        the default.

    Returns
    -------
    discrepancy : float
        Discrepancy (higher values correspond to greater sample uniformity).

    See Also
    --------
    discrepancy

    Notes
    -----
    The discrepancy can serve as a simple measure of quality of a random sample.
    This measure is based on the geometric properties of the distribution of points
    in the sample, such as the minimum distance between any pair of points, or
    the mean edge length in a minimum spanning tree.

    The higher the value is, the better the coverage of the parameter space is.
    Note that this is different from `scipy.stats.qmc.discrepancy`, where lower
    values correspond to higher quality of the sample.

    Also note that when comparing different sampling strategies using this function,
    the sample size must be kept constant.

    It is possible to calculate two metrics from the minimum spanning tree:
    the mean edge length and the standard deviation of edges lengths. Using
    both metrics offers a better picture of uniformity than either metric alone,
    with higher mean and lower standard deviation being preferable (see [1]_
    for a brief discussion). This function currently only calculates the mean
    edge length.

    Examples
    --------
    Calculate the quality of the sample using the minimum euclidean distance
    (the defaults):

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from scipy.stats import qmc
    >>> rng = np.random.default_rng(191468432622931918890291693003068437394)
    >>> sample = qmc.LatinHypercube(d=2, rng=rng).random(50)
    >>> qmc.geometric_discrepancy(sample)
    0.03708161435687876

    Calculate the quality using the mean edge length in the minimum
    spanning tree:

    >>> qmc.geometric_discrepancy(sample, method='mst')
    0.1105149978798376

    Display the minimum spanning tree and the points with
    the smallest distance:

    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> from matplotlib.lines import Line2D
    >>> from scipy.sparse.csgraph import minimum_spanning_tree
    >>> from scipy.spatial.distance import pdist, squareform
    >>> dist = pdist(sample)
    >>> mst = minimum_spanning_tree(squareform(dist))
    >>> edges = np.where(mst.toarray() > 0)
    >>> edges = np.asarray(edges).T
    >>> min_dist = np.min(dist)
    >>> min_idx = np.argwhere(squareform(dist) == min_dist)[0]
    >>> fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 5))
    >>> _ = ax.set(aspect='equal', xlabel=r'$x_1$', ylabel=r'$x_2$',
    ...            xlim=[0, 1], ylim=[0, 1])
    >>> for edge in edges:
    ...     ax.plot(sample[edge, 0], sample[edge, 1], c='k')
    >>> ax.scatter(sample[:, 0], sample[:, 1])
    >>> ax.add_patch(plt.Circle(sample[min_idx[0]], min_dist, color='red', fill=False))
    >>> markers = [
    ...     Line2D([0], [0], marker='o', lw=0, label='Sample points'),
    ...     Line2D([0], [0], color='k', label='Minimum spanning tree'),
    ...     Line2D([0], [0], marker='o', lw=0, markerfacecolor='w', markeredgecolor='r',
    ...            label='Minimum point-to-point distance'),
    ... ]
    >>> ax.legend(handles=markers, loc='center left', bbox_to_anchor=(1, 0.5));
    >>> plt.show()
