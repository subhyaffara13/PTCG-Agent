def is_weakly_connected(G):
    """Test directed graph for weak connectivity.

    A directed graph is weakly connected if and only if the graph
    is connected when the direction of the edge between nodes is ignored.

    Note that if a graph is strongly connected (i.e. the graph is connected
    even when we account for directionality), it is by definition weakly
    connected as well.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX Graph
        A directed graph.

    Returns
    -------
    connected : bool
        True if the graph is weakly connected, False otherwise.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXNotImplemented
        If G is undirected.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.DiGraph([(0, 1), (2, 1)])
    >>> G.add_node(3)
    >>> nx.is_weakly_connected(G)  # node 3 is not connected to the graph
    False
    >>> G.add_edge(2, 3)
    >>> nx.is_weakly_connected(G)
    True
