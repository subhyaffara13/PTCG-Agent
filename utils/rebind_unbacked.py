    When this happens, we need to tell the shape environment about the equivalence
    of the old and new unbacked SymInts.  Pass us the old torch.fx.Node (which
    has the old binding information) and the new result (which we can extract the
    new unbacked SymInts out from).

            #
            # First, you might have a runtime assert that causes the
            # constant-ification.  In this case, the /binding/ itself will
            # still be an unbacked symbol (because we will only force it
            # to be a constant later in fake tensor propagation).  In this
            # case, u1 is a SymInt and we still do all our work as normal.
            #
            # But second, it might be that fake tensor propagation DIRECTLY
            # converted the unbacked SymInt into a constant.  This happens
            # more rarely, but we have identified two situations it can
            # validly occur:
            #
            # - If you have a tensor_version operator, these are initially
            #   allocated as unbacked SymInts, but after AOTAutograd they
            #   get forced specialized to specific values.  In this case,
            #   there is no reason to do runtime asserts on them, this is
            #   just a hack to properly keep track of them to start.
            #
            # - If you have an item() call on a constant tensor, the result
            #   of the item() call is constant and we do not need runtime
            #   asserts on this symbol.  In
            #   https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/140625 we have a
            #   case where in the initial trace of the program we are unable
            #   to determine that torch.tensor is constant, but then
            #   subsequent passes cause torch.tensor to become a constant and
            #   then the unbacked symbol goes poof.
            #
            # In all of these cases, it is no longer necessary to generate
            # deferred runtime asserts, since other subsystems (e.g., the
            # constant-ification pass) ensure that the quantity is now truly
            # static and cannot change at runtime.  So it's OK to discard
            # in these situations.
            #
            # There is one more hazard (re
            # https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/141248), the problem
            # is that you can end up with "dangling" unbacked symbols that
            # exist in the ShapeEnv but are never bound anywhere.  You might
            # like an invariant that unbacked symbols never get lost.  But
