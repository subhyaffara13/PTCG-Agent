def igcd(*args):
    """Computes nonnegative integer greatest common divisor.

    Explanation
    ===========

    The algorithm is based on the well known Euclid's algorithm [1]_. To
    improve speed, ``igcd()`` has its own caching mechanism.
    If you do not need the cache mechanism, using ``sympy.external.gmpy.gcd``.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import igcd
    >>> igcd(2, 4)
    2
    >>> igcd(5, 10, 15)
    5
