    Shard the buffers along the sequence dimensions according to CP rules.
    Args:
        mesh (:class:`DeviceMesh`): the device mesh for the context parallelism.
        buffers (List[torch.Tensor]): the buffers to be sharded.
        seq_dims (List[int]): the sequence dimensions of ``buffers``. This list
            must have the same length as ``buffers``.
        load_balancer (Optional[:class:`_LoadBalancer`]): an optional `_LoadBalancer`
            object. If this argument is `None`, it means the `buffers` need no
            rearrangement before being sharded. If this argument is a `_LoadBalancer`
            object, call its `_generate_indices(restore=False)` to generate the
            rearrangement indices such that each shard of `buffer[rearrange_idx]` is
            well-balanced (i.e., having close sparsities).

    Returns:
        List[torch.Tensor]: the sharded buffers.

    Note:
        For `_context_parallel_shard` we require a non-None `load_balancer` object to be
        explicitly passed if load-balancing is needed.
