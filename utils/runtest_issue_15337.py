    # NOTE : autowrap was originally designed to only accept an iterable for
    # the kwarg "helpers", but in issue 10274 the user mistakenly thought that
    # if there was only a single helper it did not need to be passed via an
    # iterable that wrapped the helper tuple. There were no tests for this
    # behavior so when the code was changed to accept a single tuple it broke
    # the original behavior. These tests below ensure that both now work.
