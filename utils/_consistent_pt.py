def _consistent_PT(u, v, graph_params, state_params):
    """Checks the consistency of extending the mapping using the current node pair.

    Parameters
    ----------
    u, v: Graph node
        The two candidate nodes being examined.

    graph_params: namedtuple
        Contains all the Graph-related parameters:

        G1,G2: NetworkX Graph or MultiGraph instances.
            The two graphs to check for isomorphism or monomorphism

        G1_labels,G2_labels: dict
            The label of every node in G1 and G2 respectively

    state_params: namedtuple
        Contains all the State-related parameters:

        mapping: dict
            The mapping as extended so far. Maps nodes of G1 to nodes of G2

        reverse_mapping: dict
            The reverse mapping as extended so far. Maps nodes from G2 to nodes of G1.
            It's basically "mapping" reversed

        T1, T2: set
            Ti contains uncovered neighbors of covered nodes from Gi, i.e. nodes
            that are not in the mapping, but are neighbors of nodes that are.

        T1_out, T2_out: set
            Ti_out contains all the nodes from Gi, that are neither in the mapping
            nor in Ti

    Returns
    -------
    True if the pair passes all the consistency checks successfully. False otherwise.
