    """Convenience function which waits for a list of processes to
    terminate.

    Return a (gone, alive) tuple indicating which processes
    are gone and which ones are still alive.

    The gone ones will have a new *returncode* attribute indicating
    process exit status (may be None).

    *callback* is a function which gets called every time a process
    terminates (a Process instance is passed as callback argument).

    Function will return as soon as all processes terminate or when
    *timeout* occurs.
    Differently from Process.wait() it will not raise TimeoutExpired if
    *timeout* occurs.

    Typical use case is:

     - send SIGTERM to a list of processes
     - give them some time to terminate
     - send SIGKILL to those ones which are still alive

    Example:

    >>> def on_terminate(proc):
    ...     print("process {} terminated".format(proc))
    ...
    >>> for p in procs:
    ...    p.terminate()
    ...
    >>> gone, alive = wait_procs(procs, timeout=3, callback=on_terminate)
    >>> for p in alive:
    ...     p.kill()
