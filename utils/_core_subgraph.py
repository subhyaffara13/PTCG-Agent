    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
       The graph or directed graph to process
    k_filter : filter function
       This function filters the nodes chosen. It takes three inputs:
       A node of G, the filter's cutoff, and the core dict of the graph.
       The function should return a Boolean value.
    k : int, optional
      The order of the core. If not specified use the max core number.
      This value is used as the cutoff for the filter.
    core : dict, optional
      Precomputed core numbers keyed by node for the graph `G`.
      If not specified, the core numbers will be computed from `G`.
