def is_branching(G):
    """
    Returns True if `G` is a branching.

    A branching is a directed forest with maximum in-degree equal to 1.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : directed graph
        The directed graph to test.

    Returns
    -------
    b : bool
        A boolean that is True if `G` is a branching.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.DiGraph([(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)])
    >>> nx.is_branching(G)
    True
    >>> G.remove_edge(2, 3)
    >>> G.add_edge(3, 1)  # maximum in-degree is 2
    >>> nx.is_branching(G)
    False

    Notes
    -----
    In another convention, a branching is also known as a *forest*.
