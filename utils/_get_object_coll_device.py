    Return the device type to use with ``group`` for object collectives or

        1. If user specifies exactly one backend in ``init_process_group`` call:

        2. Else if user specifies multiple "device:backend" pairs in init_process_group:

            Otherwise, use the first backend (sort of a random pick).

    Args:
        group (ProcessGroup, optional): The process group to work on. If None,
