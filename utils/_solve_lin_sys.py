def _solve_lin_sys(eqs_coeffs, eqs_rhs, ring):
    """Solve a linear system from dict of PolynomialRing coefficients

    Explanation
    ===========

    This is an **internal** function used by :func:`solve_lin_sys` after the
    equations have been preprocessed. The role of this function is to split
    the system into connected components and pass those to
    :func:`_solve_lin_sys_component`.

    Examples
    ========

    Setup a system for $x-y=0$ and $x+y=2$ and solve:

    >>> from sympy import symbols, sring
    >>> from sympy.polys.solvers import _solve_lin_sys
    >>> x, y = symbols('x, y')
    >>> R, (xr, yr) = sring([x, y], [x, y])
    >>> eqs = [{xr:R.one, yr:-R.one}, {xr:R.one, yr:R.one}]
    >>> eqs_rhs = [R.zero, -2*R.one]
    >>> _solve_lin_sys(eqs, eqs_rhs, R)
    {y: 1, x: 1}
