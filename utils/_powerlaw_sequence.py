    ``gamma`` and ``low`` are the parameters for the Zipf distribution.

    ``high`` is the maximum allowed value for values draw from the Zipf
    distribution. For more information, see :func:`_zipf_rv_below`.

    ``condition`` and ``length`` are Boolean-valued functions on
    lists. While generating the list, random values are drawn and
    appended to the list until ``length`` is satisfied by the created
    list. Once ``condition`` is satisfied, the sequence generated in
    this way is returned.

    ``max_iters`` indicates the number of times to generate a list
    satisfying ``length``. If the number of iterations exceeds this
    value, :exc:`~networkx.exception.ExceededMaxIterations` is raised.

    seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
        Indicator of random number generation state.
