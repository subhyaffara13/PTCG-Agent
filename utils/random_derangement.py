def random_derangement(t, choice=None, strict=True):
    """Return a list of elements in which none are in the same positions
    as they were originally. If an element fills more than half of the positions
    then an error will be raised since no derangement is possible. To obtain
    a derangement of as many items as possible--with some of the most numerous
    remaining in their original positions--pass `strict=False`. To produce a
    pseudorandom derangment, pass a pseudorandom selector like `choice` (see
    below).

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.utilities.iterables import random_derangement
    >>> t = 'SymPy: a CAS in pure Python'
    >>> d = random_derangement(t)
    >>> all(i != j for i, j in zip(d, t))
    True

    A predictable result can be obtained by using a pseudorandom
    generator for the choice:

    >>> from sympy.core.random import seed, choice as c
    >>> seed(1)
    >>> d = [''.join(random_derangement(t, c)) for i in range(5)]
    >>> assert len(set(d)) != 1  # we got different values

    By reseeding, the same sequence can be obtained:

    >>> seed(1)
    >>> d2 = [''.join(random_derangement(t, c)) for i in range(5)]
    >>> assert d == d2
