    For col-wise sharding of weight, we need to aggregate the
    norm across all ranks before we can perform the proper re-norm.
    Note that, the max_norm logic is only applied to the embedding
    indices that are looked up and not the whole shard.

    Args:
        max_norm: If given, each embedding vector with norm larger
            than max_norm is renormalized to have norm max_norm.
            Note: this will modify weight in-place.
        norm_type: The p in the p-norm to compute for the max_norm option.
        local_shard: col-wise shared local weight used for lookup.
        input: tensor to be applied op to.
        world_size: number of ranks.
        gathered_inputs: list of inputs from all ranks.
        pg: process group.

    Return:
        local_shard_norm_renormed: local_shard re-normed to max_norm if the norm is larger
