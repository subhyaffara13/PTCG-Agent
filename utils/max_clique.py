def max_clique(G):
    r"""Find the Maximum Clique

    Finds the $O(|V|/(log|V|)^2)$ apx of maximum clique/independent set
    in the worst case.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
        Undirected graph

    Returns
    -------
    clique : set
        The apx-maximum clique of the graph

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.path_graph(10)
    >>> nx.approximation.max_clique(G)
    {8, 9}

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXNotImplemented
        If the graph is directed or is a multigraph.

    Notes
    -----
    A clique in an undirected graph G = (V, E) is a subset of the vertex set
    `C \subseteq V` such that for every two vertices in C there exists an edge
    connecting the two. This is equivalent to saying that the subgraph
    induced by C is complete (in some cases, the term clique may also refer
    to the subgraph).

    A maximum clique is a clique of the largest possible size in a given graph.
    The clique number `\omega(G)` of a graph G is the number of
    vertices in a maximum clique in G. The intersection number of
    G is the smallest number of cliques that together cover all edges of G.
