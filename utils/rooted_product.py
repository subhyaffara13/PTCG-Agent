def rooted_product(G, H, root):
    """Return the rooted product of graphs G and H rooted at root in H.

    A new graph is constructed representing the rooted product of
    the inputted graphs, G and H, with a root in H.
    A rooted product duplicates H for each nodes in G with the root
    of H corresponding to the node in G. Nodes are renamed as the direct
    product of G and H. The result is a subgraph of the cartesian product.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G,H : graph
       A NetworkX graph
    root : node
       A node in H

    Returns
    -------
    R : The rooted product of G and H with a specified root in H

    Notes
    -----
    The nodes of R are the Cartesian Product of the nodes of G and H.
    The nodes of G and H are not relabeled.
