def kvp(v, z, n=1):
    """Compute derivatives of real-order modified Bessel function Kv(z).

    Kv(z) is the modified Bessel function of the second kind.
    Derivative is calculated with respect to `z`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    v : array_like of float
        Order of Bessel function
    z : array_like of complex
        Argument at which to evaluate the derivative
    n : int, default 1
        Order of derivative. For 0 returns the Bessel function `kv` itself.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray
        The results

    See Also
    --------
    kv

    Notes
    -----
    The derivative is computed using the relation DLFM 10.29.5 [2]_.

    Examples
    --------
    Compute the modified bessel function of the second kind of order 0 and
    its first two derivatives at 1.

    >>> from scipy.special import kvp
    >>> kvp(0, 1, 0), kvp(0, 1, 1), kvp(0, 1, 2)
    (0.42102443824070834, -0.6019072301972346, 1.0229316684379428)

    Compute the first derivative of the modified Bessel function of the second
    kind for several orders at 1 by providing an array for `v`.

    >>> kvp([0, 1, 2], 1, 1)
    array([-0.60190723, -1.02293167, -3.85158503])

    Compute the first derivative of the modified Bessel function of the
    second kind of order 0 at several points by providing an array for `z`.

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> points = np.array([0.5, 1.5, 3.])
    >>> kvp(0, points, 1)
    array([-1.65644112, -0.2773878 , -0.04015643])

    Plot the modified bessel function of the second kind and its
    first three derivatives.

    >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    >>> x = np.linspace(0, 5, 1000)
    >>> fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    >>> ax.plot(x, kvp(1, x, 0), label=r"$K_1$")
    >>> ax.plot(x, kvp(1, x, 1), label=r"$K_1'$")
    >>> ax.plot(x, kvp(1, x, 2), label=r"$K_1''$")
    >>> ax.plot(x, kvp(1, x, 3), label=r"$K_1'''$")
    >>> ax.set_ylim(-2.5, 2.5)
    >>> plt.legend()
    >>> plt.show()
