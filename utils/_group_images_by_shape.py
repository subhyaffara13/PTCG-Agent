    """
    Helper function to flatten a single level of nested image and batch structures and group by shape.
    Args:
        nested_images (list):
            A list of images or a single tensor
        paired_inputs (Any, *optional*):
            Zero or more lists that mirror the structure of `nested_images` (flat list, or list of lists when
            `is_nested=True`). Each element is paired 1:1 with the corresponding image so it can be grouped by the
            same shape key. These paired values are grouped alongside `nested_images` but are not stacked in the output, so
            they do not need to be tensors.
        is_nested (bool, *optional*, defaults to False):
            Whether the images are nested.
    Returns:
        tuple[dict, ...]:
            - A dictionary with shape as key and list of images with that shape as value
            - A dictionary with shape as key and list of paired values with that shape as value
            - A dictionary mapping original indices to (shape, index) tuples
            - A dictionary mapping original indices to (shape, index) tuples for each paired input
