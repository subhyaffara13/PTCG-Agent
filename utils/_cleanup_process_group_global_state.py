def _cleanup_process_group_global_state(pg: ProcessGroup) -> None:
    """
    Clean up all global state associated with a process group.

    This function ensures complete cleanup of process group state from all
    global dictionaries and registries, even if destroy_process_group fails
    or doesn't clean up everything. This is critical when destroying multiple
    groups to prevent inconsistent state.

    The cleanup removes the process group from:
    - _world.pg_map (backend and store mapping)
    - _world.pg_names (group name mapping)
    - _world.pg_group_ranks (rank mappings)
    - _world.pg_backend_config (backend configuration)
    - _world.tags_to_pg and _world.pg_to_tag (tag mappings)
    - _world.pg_coalesce_state (coalescing state)
    - C++ internal registries via _unregister_process_group

    Args:
        pg (ProcessGroup): The process group to clean up.
