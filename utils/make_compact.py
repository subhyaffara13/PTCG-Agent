def make_compact(creation_sequence):
    """
    Returns the creation sequence in a compact form
    that is the number of 'i's and 'd's alternating.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from networkx.algorithms.threshold import make_compact
    >>> make_compact(["d", "i", "i", "d", "d", "i", "i", "i"])
    [1, 2, 2, 3]
    >>> make_compact(["d", "d", "d", "i", "d", "d"])
    [3, 1, 2]

    Notice that the first number is the first vertex
    to be used for construction and so is always 'd'.

    Labeled creation sequences lose their labels in the
    compact representation.

    >>> make_compact([3, 1, 2])
    [3, 1, 2]
