    r"""Never mix tabs and spaces.

    The most popular way of indenting Python is with spaces only.  The
    second-most popular way is with tabs only.  Code indented with a
    mixture of tabs and spaces should be converted to using spaces
    exclusively.  When invoking the Python command line interpreter with
    the -t option, it issues warnings about code that illegally mixes
    tabs and spaces.  When using -tt these warnings become errors.
    These options are highly recommended!
