    """
    Given inputs for a linear programming problem in preferred format,
    presolve the problem: identify trivial infeasibilities, redundancies,
    and unboundedness, tighten bounds where possible, and eliminate fixed
    variables.

    Parameters
    ----------
    lp : A `scipy.optimize._linprog_util._LPProblem` consisting of the following fields:

        c : 1D array
            The coefficients of the linear objective function to be minimized.
        A_ub : 2D array, optional
            The inequality constraint matrix. Each row of ``A_ub`` specifies the
            coefficients of a linear inequality constraint on ``x``.
        b_ub : 1D array, optional
            The inequality constraint vector. Each element represents an
            upper bound on the corresponding value of ``A_ub @ x``.
        A_eq : 2D array, optional
            The equality constraint matrix. Each row of ``A_eq`` specifies the
            coefficients of a linear equality constraint on ``x``.
        b_eq : 1D array, optional
            The equality constraint vector. Each element of ``A_eq @ x`` must equal
            the corresponding element of ``b_eq``.
        bounds : 2D array
            The bounds of ``x``, as ``min`` and ``max`` pairs, one for each of the N
            elements of ``x``. The N x 2 array contains lower bounds in the first
            column and upper bounds in the 2nd. Unbounded variables have lower
            bound -np.inf and/or upper bound np.inf.
        x0 : 1D array, optional
            Guess values of the decision variables, which will be refined by
            the optimization algorithm. This argument is currently used only by the
            'revised simplex' method, and can only be used if `x0` represents a
            basic feasible solution.

    rr : bool
        If ``True`` attempts to eliminate any redundant rows in ``A_eq``.
        Set False if ``A_eq`` is known to be of full row rank, or if you are
        looking for a potential speedup (at the expense of reliability).
    rr_method : str
        Method used to identify and remove redundant rows from the
        equality constraint matrix after presolve.
    tol : float
        The tolerance which determines when a solution is "close enough" to
        zero in Phase 1 to be considered a basic feasible solution or close
        enough to positive to serve as an optimal solution.

    Returns
    -------
    lp : A `scipy.optimize._linprog_util._LPProblem` consisting of the following fields:

        c : 1D array
            The coefficients of the linear objective function to be minimized.
        A_ub : 2D array, optional
            The inequality constraint matrix. Each row of ``A_ub`` specifies the
            coefficients of a linear inequality constraint on ``x``.
        b_ub : 1D array, optional
            The inequality constraint vector. Each element represents an
            upper bound on the corresponding value of ``A_ub @ x``.
        A_eq : 2D array, optional
            The equality constraint matrix. Each row of ``A_eq`` specifies the
            coefficients of a linear equality constraint on ``x``.
        b_eq : 1D array, optional
            The equality constraint vector. Each element of ``A_eq @ x`` must equal
            the corresponding element of ``b_eq``.
        bounds : 2D array
            The bounds of ``x``, as ``min`` and ``max`` pairs, possibly tightened.
        x0 : 1D array, optional
            Guess values of the decision variables, which will be refined by
            the optimization algorithm. This argument is currently used only by the
            'revised simplex' method, and can only be used if `x0` represents a
            basic feasible solution.

    c0 : 1D array
        Constant term in objective function due to fixed (and eliminated)
        variables.
    x : 1D array
        Solution vector (when the solution is trivial and can be determined
        in presolve)
    revstack: list of functions
        the functions in the list reverse the operations of _presolve()
        the function signature is x_org = f(x_mod), where x_mod is the result
        of a presolve step and x_org the value at the start of the step
        (currently, the revstack contains only one function)
    complete: bool
        Whether the solution is complete (solved or determined to be infeasible
        or unbounded in presolve)
    status : int
        An integer representing the exit status of the optimization::

         0 : Optimization terminated successfully
         1 : Iteration limit reached
         2 : Problem appears to be infeasible
         3 : Problem appears to be unbounded
         4 : Serious numerical difficulties encountered

    message : str
        A string descriptor of the exit status of the optimization.
