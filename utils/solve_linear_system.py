def solve_linear_system(system, *symbols, **flags):
    r"""
    Solve system of $N$ linear equations with $M$ variables, which means
    both under- and overdetermined systems are supported.

    Explanation
    ===========

    The possible number of solutions is zero, one, or infinite. Respectively,
    this procedure will return None or a dictionary with solutions. In the
    case of underdetermined systems, all arbitrary parameters are skipped.
    This may cause a situation in which an empty dictionary is returned.
    In that case, all symbols can be assigned arbitrary values.

    Input to this function is a $N\times M + 1$ matrix, which means it has
    to be in augmented form. If you prefer to enter $N$ equations and $M$
    unknowns then use ``solve(Neqs, *Msymbols)`` instead. Note: a local
    copy of the matrix is made by this routine so the matrix that is
    passed will not be modified.

    The algorithm used here is fraction-free Gaussian elimination,
    which results, after elimination, in an upper-triangular matrix.
    Then solutions are found using back-substitution. This approach
    is more efficient and compact than the Gauss-Jordan method.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import Matrix, solve_linear_system
    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y

    Solve the following system::

           x + 4 y ==  2
        -2 x +   y == 14

    >>> system = Matrix(( (1, 4, 2), (-2, 1, 14)))
    >>> solve_linear_system(system, x, y)
    {x: -6, y: 2}

    A degenerate system returns an empty dictionary:

    >>> system = Matrix(( (0,0,0), (0,0,0) ))
    >>> solve_linear_system(system, x, y)
    {}

    """
    assert system.shape[1] == len(symbols) + 1

    # This is just a wrapper for solve_lin_sys
    eqs = list(system * Matrix(symbols + (-1,)))
    eqs, ring = sympy_eqs_to_ring(eqs, symbols)
    sol = solve_lin_sys(eqs, ring, _raw=False)
    if sol is not None:
        sol = {sym:val for sym, val in sol.items() if sym != val}
    return sol
