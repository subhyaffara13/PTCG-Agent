def matrix_to_vector(matrix, system):
    """
    Converts a vector in matrix form to a Vector instance.

    It is assumed that the elements of the Matrix represent the
    measure numbers of the components of the vector along basis
    vectors of 'system'.

    Parameters
    ==========

    matrix : SymPy Matrix, Dimensions: (3, 1)
        The matrix to be converted to a vector

    system : CoordSys3D
        The coordinate system the vector is to be defined in

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import ImmutableMatrix as Matrix
    >>> m = Matrix([1, 2, 3])
    >>> from sympy.vector import CoordSys3D, matrix_to_vector
    >>> C = CoordSys3D('C')
    >>> v = matrix_to_vector(m, C)
    >>> v
    C.i + 2*C.j + 3*C.k
    >>> v.to_matrix(C) == m
    True
