def large_clique_size(G):
    """Find the size of a large clique in a graph.

    A *clique* is a subset of nodes in which each pair of nodes is
    adjacent. This function is a heuristic for finding the size of a
    large clique in the graph.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    Returns
    -------
    k: integer
       The size of a large clique in the graph.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.path_graph(10)
    >>> nx.approximation.large_clique_size(G)
    2

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXNotImplemented
        If the graph is directed or is a multigraph.

    Notes
    -----
    This implementation is from [1]_. Its worst case time complexity is
    :math:`O(n d^2)`, where *n* is the number of nodes in the graph and
    *d* is the maximum degree.

    This function is a heuristic, which means it may work well in
    practice, but there is no rigorous mathematical guarantee on the
    ratio between the returned number and the actual largest clique size
    in the graph.
