    """
    Update the Fortran-to-C type mapping dictionary with new mappings and
    return a list of successfully mapped C types.

    This function integrates a new mapping dictionary into an existing
    Fortran-to-C type mapping dictionary. It ensures that all keys are in
    lowercase and validates new entries against a given C-to-Python mapping
    dictionary. Redefinitions and invalid entries are reported with a warning.

    Parameters
    ----------
    f2cmap_all : dict
        The existing Fortran-to-C type mapping dictionary that will be updated.
        It should be a dictionary of dictionaries where the main keys represent
        Fortran types and the nested dictionaries map Fortran type specifiers
        to corresponding C types.

    new_map : dict
        A dictionary containing new type mappings to be added to `f2cmap_all`.
        The structure should be similar to `f2cmap_all`, with keys representing
        Fortran types and values being dictionaries of type specifiers and their
        C type equivalents.

    c2py_map : dict
        A dictionary used for validating the C types in `new_map`. It maps C
        types to corresponding Python types and is used to ensure that the C
        types specified in `new_map` are valid.

    verbose : boolean
        A flag used to provide information about the types mapped

    Returns
    -------
    tuple of (dict, list)
        The updated Fortran-to-C type mapping dictionary and a list of
        successfully mapped C types.
