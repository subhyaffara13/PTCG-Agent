def find_bezier_t_intersecting_with_closedpath(
        bezier_point_at_t, inside_closedpath, t0=0., t1=1., tolerance=0.01):
    """
    Find the intersection of the Bézier curve with a closed path.

    The intersection point *t* is approximated by two parameters *t0*, *t1*
    such that *t0* <= *t* <= *t1*.

    Search starts from *t0* and *t1* and uses a simple bisecting algorithm
    therefore one of the end points must be inside the path while the other
    doesn't. The search stops when the distance of the points parametrized by
    *t0* and *t1* gets smaller than the given *tolerance*.

    Parameters
    ----------
    bezier_point_at_t : callable
        A function returning x, y coordinates of the Bézier at parameter *t*.
        It must have the signature::

            bezier_point_at_t(t: float) -> tuple[float, float]

    inside_closedpath : callable
        A function returning True if a given point (x, y) is inside the
        closed path. It must have the signature::

            inside_closedpath(point: tuple[float, float]) -> bool

    t0, t1 : float
        Start parameters for the search.

    tolerance : float
        Maximal allowed distance between the final points.

    Returns
    -------
    t0, t1 : float
        The Bézier path parameters.
