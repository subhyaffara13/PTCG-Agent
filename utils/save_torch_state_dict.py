    Save a model state dictionary to the disk, handling sharding and shared tensors issues.

    See also [`save_torch_model`] to directly save a PyTorch model.

    For more information about tensor sharing, check out [this guide](https://huggingface.co/docs/safetensors/torch_shared_tensors).

    The model state dictionary is split into shards so that each shard is smaller than a given size. The shards are
    saved in the `save_directory` with the given `filename_pattern`. If the model is too big to fit in a single shard,
    an index file is saved in the `save_directory` to indicate where each tensor is saved. This helper uses
    [`split_torch_state_dict_into_shards`] under the hood. If `safe_serialization` is `True`, the shards are saved as
    safetensors (the default). Otherwise, the shards are saved as pickle.

    Before saving the model, the `save_directory` is cleaned from any previous shard files.

    > [!WARNING]
    > If one of the model's tensor is bigger than `max_shard_size`, it will end up in its own shard which will have a
    > size greater than `max_shard_size`.

    > [!WARNING]
    > If your model is a `transformers.PreTrainedModel`, you should pass `model._tied_weights_keys` as `shared_tensors_to_discard` to properly handle shared tensors saving. This ensures the correct duplicate tensors are discarded during saving.

    Args:
        state_dict (`dict[str, torch.Tensor]`):
            The state dictionary to save.
        save_directory (`str` or `Path`):
            The directory in which the model will be saved.
        filename_pattern (`str`, *optional*):
            The pattern to generate the files names in which the model will be saved. Pattern must be a string that
            can be formatted with `filename_pattern.format(suffix=...)` and must contain the keyword `suffix`
            Defaults to `"model{suffix}.safetensors"` or `pytorch_model{suffix}.bin` depending on `safe_serialization`
            parameter.
        force_contiguous (`boolean`, *optional*):
            Forcing the state_dict to be saved as contiguous tensors. This has no effect on the correctness of the
            model, but it could potentially change performance if the layout of the tensor was chosen specifically for
            that reason. Defaults to `True`.
        max_shard_size (`int` or `str`, *optional*):
            The maximum size of each shard, in bytes. Defaults to 5GB.
        metadata (`dict[str, str]`, *optional*):
            Extra information to save along with the model. Some metadata will be added for each dropped tensors.
            This information will not be enough to recover the entire shared structure but might help understanding
            things.
        safe_serialization (`bool`, *optional*):
            Whether to save as safetensors, which is the default behavior. If `False`, the shards are saved as pickle.
            Safe serialization is recommended for security reasons. Saving as pickle is deprecated and will be removed
            in a future version.
        is_main_process (`bool`, *optional*):
            Whether the process calling this is the main process or not. Useful when in distributed training like
            TPUs and need to call this function from all processes. In this case, set `is_main_process=True` only on
            the main process to avoid race conditions. Defaults to True.
        shared_tensors_to_discard (`list[str]`, *optional*):
            List of tensor names to drop when saving shared tensors. If not provided and shared tensors are
            detected, it will drop the first name alphabetically.

    Example:

    ```py
    >>> from huggingface_hub import save_torch_state_dict
    >>> model = ... # A PyTorch model

    # Save state dict to "path/to/folder". The model will be split into shards of 5GB each and saved as safetensors.
    >>> state_dict = model_to_save.state_dict()
    >>> save_torch_state_dict(state_dict, "path/to/folder")
    ```
