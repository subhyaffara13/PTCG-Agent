def joint_degree_graph(joint_degrees, seed=None):
    """Generates a random simple graph with the given joint degree dictionary.

    Parameters
    ----------
    joint_degrees :  dictionary of dictionary of integers
        A joint degree dictionary in which entry ``joint_degrees[k][l]`` is the
        number of edges joining nodes of degree *k* with nodes of degree *l*.
    seed : integer, random_state, or None (default)
        Indicator of random number generation state.
        See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.

    Returns
    -------
    G : Graph
        A graph with the specified joint degree dictionary.

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        If *joint_degrees* dictionary is not realizable.

    Notes
    -----
    In each iteration of the "while loop" the algorithm picks two disconnected
    nodes *v* and *w*, of degree *k* and *l* correspondingly,  for which
    ``joint_degrees[k][l]`` has not reached its target yet. It then adds
    edge (*v*, *w*) and increases the number of edges in graph G by one.

    The intelligence of the algorithm lies in the fact that  it is always
    possible to add an edge between such disconnected nodes *v* and *w*,
    even if one or both nodes do not have free stubs. That is made possible by
    executing a "neighbor switch", an edge rewiring move that releases
    a free stub while keeping the joint degree of G the same.

    The algorithm continues for E (number of edges) iterations of
    the "while loop", at the which point all entries of the given
    ``joint_degrees[k][l]`` have reached their target values and the
    construction is complete.
