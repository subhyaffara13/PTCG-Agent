def read_sparse6(path):
    """Read an undirected graph in sparse6 format from path.

    Parameters
    ----------
    path : file or string
       Filename or file handle to read.
       Filenames ending in .gz or .bz2 will be decompressed.

    Returns
    -------
    G : Graph/Multigraph or list of Graphs/MultiGraphs
       If the file contains multiple lines then a list of graphs is returned

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXError
        If the string is unable to be parsed in sparse6 format

    Examples
    --------
    You can read a sparse6 file by giving the path to the file::

        >>> import tempfile
        >>> with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False) as f:
        ...     _ = f.write(b">>sparse6<<:An\\n")
        ...     _ = f.seek(0)
        ...     G = nx.read_sparse6(f.name)
        >>> list(G.edges())
        [(0, 1)]

    You can also read a sparse6 file by giving an open file-like object::

        >>> import tempfile
        >>> with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile() as f:
        ...     _ = f.write(b">>sparse6<<:An\\n")
        ...     _ = f.seek(0)
        ...     G = nx.read_sparse6(f)
        >>> list(G.edges())
        [(0, 1)]
