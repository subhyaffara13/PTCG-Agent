def _sym_ortho(a, b):
    """
    Stable implementation of Givens rotation.

    Notes
    -----
    The routine 'SymOrtho' was added for numerical stability. This is
    recommended by S.-C. Choi in [1]_.  It removes the unpleasant potential of
    ``1/eps`` in some important places (see, for example text following
    "Compute the next plane rotation Qk" in minres.py).
