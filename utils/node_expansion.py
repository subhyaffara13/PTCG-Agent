    """Returns the node expansion of the set `S`.

    The *node expansion* is the quotient of the size of the node
    boundary of *S* and the cardinality of *S*. [1]

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    S : collection
        A collection of nodes in `G`.

    Returns
    -------
    number
        The node expansion of the set `S`.
