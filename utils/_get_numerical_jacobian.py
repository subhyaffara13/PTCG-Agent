    """Compute the numerical Jacobian of `fn(inputs)` with respect to `target`.

    If not specified, targets are the input. Returns M * N Jacobians where N is the
    number of tensors in target that require grad and M is the number of non-integral
    outputs.

    Args:
        fn: the function to compute the jacobian for
        inputs: inputs to `fn`
        outputs: provide precomputed outputs to avoid one extra invocation of fn
        target: the Tensors wrt whom Jacobians are calculated (default=`inputs`)
        eps: the magnitude of the perturbation during finite differencing
             (default=`1e-3`)
        is_forward_ad: if this numerical jacobian is computed to be checked wrt
                       forward AD gradients (this is used for error checking only)

    Returns:
        A list of M N-tuples of tensors

    Note that `target` may not even be part of `input` to `fn`, so please be
    **very careful** in this to not clone `target`.
