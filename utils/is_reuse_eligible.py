    """Best-effort check for whether a traced subgraph result can be reused.

    It is possible that a subgraph is morally reusable but does not fall
    into the limited support that Dynamo has today. Current limitations:
      - The subgraph must not have side effects.
      - No sourceful variable accessed by the subgraph may have been
        mutated, because guards are snapshotted on source values at trace
        time — if the underlying object changed since then, the cached
        guards would silently evaluate against stale values.
      - Output must be a single tensor, or a tuple/list of plain tensors.
      - All flattened inputs must be one of: tensor, symnode, constant,
        unspecialized NN module — for sourceless or other input types we
        rely on the treespec and tags for structural matching, so only
        types with well-defined comparison semantics are supported.

    When ``has_reuse_hash_fn`` is True, side-effect and mutation checks are
    skipped because the hash key replaces guards — there are no guards to
    go stale from mutations.
