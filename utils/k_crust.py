def k_crust(G, k=None, core_number=None):
    """Returns the k-crust of G.

    The k-crust is the graph G with the edges of the k-core removed
    and isolated nodes found after the removal of edges are also removed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph
       A graph or directed graph.
    k : int, optional
      The order of the shell. If not specified return the main crust.
    core_number : dictionary, optional
      Precomputed core numbers for the graph G.

    Returns
    -------
    G : NetworkX graph
       The k-crust subgraph

    Raises
    ------
    NetworkXNotImplemented
        The k-crust is not implemented for multigraphs or graphs with self loops.

    Notes
    -----
    This definition of k-crust is different than the definition in [1]_.
    The k-crust in [1]_ is equivalent to the k+1 crust of this algorithm.

    For directed graphs the node degree is defined to be the
    in-degree + out-degree.

    Graph, node, and edge attributes are copied to the subgraph.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> degrees = [0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3]
    >>> H = nx.havel_hakimi_graph(degrees)
    >>> H.degree
    DegreeView({0: 1, 1: 2, 2: 2, 3: 2, 4: 2, 5: 3, 6: 0})
    >>> nx.k_crust(H, k=1).nodes
    NodeView((0, 4, 6))
