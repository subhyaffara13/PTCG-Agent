def _compute_norm(t, n, dim):
    r"""Compute the L_n-norm of a tensor along all dimensions except for the specified dimension.

    The L_n-norm will be computed across all entries in tensor `t` along all dimension
    except for the one identified by dim.
    Example: if `t` is of shape, say, 3x2x4 and dim=2 (the last dim),
    then norm will have Size [4], and each entry will represent the
    `L_n`-norm computed using the 3x2=6 entries for each of the 4 channels.

    Args:
        t (torch.Tensor): tensor representing the parameter to prune
        n (int, float, inf, -inf, 'fro', 'nuc'): See documentation of valid
            entries for argument p in torch.norm
        dim (int): dim identifying the channels to prune

    Returns:
        norm (torch.Tensor): L_n norm computed across all dimensions except
            for `dim`. By construction, `norm.shape = t.shape[-1]`.

    # dims = all axes, except for the one identified by `dim`
    dims = list(range(t.dim()))
    # convert negative indexing
    if dim < 0:
        dim = dims[dim]
    dims.remove(dim)

    norm = torch.norm(t, p=n, dim=dims)
    return norm
