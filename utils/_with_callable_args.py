def _with_callable_args(cls_or_self, **kwargs):
    r"""Wrapper that allows creation of class factories args that need to be
    called at construction time.

    This can be useful when there is a need to create classes with the same
    constructor arguments, but different instances and those arguments should only
    be calculated at construction time. Can be used in conjunction with _with_args

    Example::

        >>> # xdoctest: +SKIP("Undefined vars")
        >>> Foo.with_callable_args = classmethod(_with_callable_args)
        >>> Foo.with_args = classmethod(_with_args)
        >>> foo_builder = Foo.with_callable_args(cur_time=get_time_func).with_args(name="dan")
        >>> foo_instance1 = foo_builder()
        >>> # wait 50
        >>> foo_instance2 = foo_builder()
        >>> id(foo_instance1.creation_time) == id(foo_instance2.creation_time)
        False
