    Gives a power series solution to a second order homogeneous differential
    equation with polynomial coefficients at a regular point. A second order
    homogeneous differential equation is of the form

    .. math :: P(x)\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} + Q(x)\frac{dy}{dx} + R(x) y(x) = 0

    A point is said to regular singular at `x0` if `x - x0\frac{Q(x)}{P(x)}`
    and `(x - x0)^{2}\frac{R(x)}{P(x)}` are analytic at `x0`. For simplicity
    `P(x)`, `Q(x)` and `R(x)` are assumed to be polynomials. The algorithm for
    finding the power series solutions is:

    1.  Try expressing `(x - x0)P(x)` and `((x - x0)^{2})Q(x)` as power series
        solutions about x0. Find `p0` and `q0` which are the constants of the
        power series expansions.
    2.  Solve the indicial equation `f(m) = m(m - 1) + m*p0 + q0`, to obtain the
        roots `m1` and `m2` of the indicial equation.
    3.  If `m1 - m2` is a non integer there exists two series solutions. If
        `m1 = m2`, there exists only one solution. If `m1 - m2` is an integer,
        then the existence of one solution is confirmed. The other solution may
        or may not exist.

    The power series solution is of the form `x^{m}\sum_{n=0}^\infty a_{n}x^{n}`. The
    coefficients are determined by the following recurrence relation.
    `a_{n} = -\frac{\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} q_{n-k} + (m + k)p_{n-k}}{f(m + n)}`. For the case
    in which `m1 - m2` is an integer, it can be seen from the recurrence relation
    that for the lower root `m`, when `n` equals the difference of both the
    roots, the denominator becomes zero. So if the numerator is not equal to zero,
    a second series solution exists.
