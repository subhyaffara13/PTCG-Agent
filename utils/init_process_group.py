    Initialize the default distributed process group.

    This will also initialize the distributed package.

    There are 2 main ways to initialize a process group:
        1. Specify ``store``, ``rank``, and ``world_size`` explicitly.
        2. Specify ``init_method`` (a URL string) which indicates where/how
           to discover peers. Optionally specify ``rank`` and ``world_size``,
           or encode all required parameters in the URL and omit them.

    If neither is specified, ``init_method`` is assumed to be "env://".


    Args:
        backend (str or Backend, optional): The backend to use. Depending on
            build-time configurations, valid values include ``mpi``, ``gloo``,
            ``nccl``, ``ucc``, ``xccl`` or one that is registered by a third-party
            plugin.
            Since 2.6, if ``backend`` is not provided, c10d will use a backend
            registered for the device type indicated by the `device_id` kwarg
            (if provided). The known default registrations today are: ``nccl``
            for ``cuda``, ``gloo`` for ``cpu``, ``xccl`` for ``xpu``.
            If neither ``backend`` nor ``device_id`` is provided, c10d will
            detect the accelerator on the run-time machine and use a backend
            registered for that detected accelerator (or ``cpu``).
            This field can be given as a lowercase string (e.g., ``"gloo"``),
            which can also be accessed via :class:`Backend` attributes (e.g.,
            ``Backend.GLOO``).
            If using multiple processes per machine with ``nccl`` backend, each
            process must have exclusive access to every GPU it uses, as sharing
            GPUs between processes can result in deadlock or NCCL invalid usage.
            ``ucc`` backend is experimental.
            Default backend for the device can be queried with
            :func:`get_default_backend_for_device`.
        init_method (str, optional): URL specifying how to initialize the
                                     process group. Default is "env://" if no
                                     ``init_method`` or ``store`` is specified.
                                     Mutually exclusive with ``store``.
        world_size (int, optional): Number of processes participating in
                                    the job. Required if ``store`` is specified.
        rank (int, optional): Rank of the current process (it should be a
                              number between 0 and ``world_size``-1).
                              Required if ``store`` is specified.
        store(Store, optional): Key/value store accessible to all workers, used
                                to exchange connection/address information.
                                Mutually exclusive with ``init_method``.
        timeout (timedelta, optional): Timeout for operations executed against
            the process group. Default value is 10 minutes for NCCL and 30 minutes for other backends.
            This is the duration after which collectives will be aborted asynchronously and the process will crash.
            This is done since CUDA execution is async and it is no longer safe to continue executing user code since
            failed async NCCL operations might result in subsequent CUDA operations running on corrupted data.
            When TORCH_NCCL_BLOCKING_WAIT is set, the process will block and wait for this timeout.

        group_name (str, optional, deprecated): Group name. This argument is ignored
        pg_options (ProcessGroupOptions, optional): process group options
            specifying what additional options need to be passed in during
            the construction of specific process groups. As of now, the only
            options we support is ``ProcessGroupNCCL.Options`` for the ``nccl``
            backend, ``is_high_priority_stream`` can be specified so that
            the nccl backend can pick up high priority cuda streams when
            there're compute kernels waiting. For other available options to config nccl,
            See https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/nccl/user-guide/docs/api/types.html#ncclconfig-t
        device_id (torch.device | int, optional): a single, specific device
            this process will work on, allowing for backend-specific
            optimizations.  Currently this has two effects, only under
            NCCL: the communicator is immediately formed (calling
            ``ncclCommInit*`` immediately rather than the normal lazy
            call) and sub-groups will use ``ncclCommSplit`` when
            possible to avoid unnecessary overhead of group creation. If you
            want to know NCCL initialization error early, you can also use this
            field. If an `int` is provided, the API assumes that the accelerator
            type at compile time will be used.
        _ranks: The ranks in the process group. If provided, the process
               group name will be the hash of all the ranks in the group.

    .. note:: To enable ``backend == Backend.MPI``, PyTorch needs to be built from source
        on a system that supports MPI.

    .. note:: Support for multiple backends is experimental. Currently when no backend is
        specified, both ``gloo`` and ``nccl`` backends will be created. The ``gloo`` backend
        will be used for collectives with CPU tensors and the ``nccl`` backend will be used
        for collectives with CUDA tensors. A custom backend can be specified by passing in
        a string with format "<device_type>:<backend_name>,<device_type>:<backend_name>", e.g.
        "cpu:gloo,cuda:custom_backend".
