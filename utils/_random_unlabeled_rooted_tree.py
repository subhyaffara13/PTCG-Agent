    """Returns an unlabeled rooted tree with `n` nodes.

    Returns an unlabeled rooted tree with `n` nodes chosen uniformly
    at random using the "RANRUT" algorithm from [1]_.
    The tree is returned in the form: (list_of_edges, number_of_nodes)

    Parameters
    ----------
    n : int
        The number of nodes, greater than zero.
    cache_trees : list ints
        Cache for :func:`_num_rooted_trees`.
    seed : random_state
        See :ref:`Randomness<randomness>`.

    Returns
    -------
    (list_of_edges, number_of_nodes) : list, int
        A random unlabeled rooted tree with `n` nodes as a 2-tuple
        ``(list_of_edges, number_of_nodes)``.
        The root is node 0.
