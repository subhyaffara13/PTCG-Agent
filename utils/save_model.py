    Saves a given torch model to specified filename.

        metadata (`Dict[str, str]`, *optional*):
            Extra information to save along with the file.
            Some metadata will be added for each dropped tensors.
            This information will not be enough to recover the entire
            shared structure but might help understanding things

            Forcing the state_dict to be saved as contiguous tensors.
            This has no effect on the correctness of the model, but it
            could potentially change performance if the layout of the tensor
            was chosen specifically for that reason.
