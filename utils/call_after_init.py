  If ABSL has already finished initialization when ``call_after_init`` is
  called then the callback is executed immediately, otherwise `callback` is
  stored to be executed after ``app.run`` has finished initializing (aka. just
  before the main function is called).

  If called after ``app.run``, this is equivalent to calling ``callback()`` in
  the caller thread. If called before ``app.run``, callbacks are run
  sequentially (in an undefined order) in the same thread as ``app.run``.

  Args:
    callback: a callable to be called once ABSL has finished initialization.
      This may be immediate if initialization has already finished. It
      takes no arguments and returns nothing.
