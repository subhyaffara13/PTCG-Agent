        - use_derived: we want to call the implementation on CPUDoubleType
          (or a similar, derived Type instance).  Because these derived
          instances deal in Tensors, not Variables (it's a completely different
          object, so it doesn't dispatch back to VariableType), code on
          this dispatch path needs to wrap/unwrap tensors.  If the
          derived implementation takes and returns tensors, the
          implementation is usually differentiable (although we also use
          the derived dispatch path for non-differentiable functions
          that we still want to dispatch on the derived Type instance;
          e.g., size())
        - use_type: we want to call the implementation on Type, because
          it is implemented concretely, and the functions it invokes will
          get dispatched back to VariableType (which will ensure that they
          are differentiable.)
