    r"""
    Solves a first order linear homogeneous
    partial differential equation with constant coefficients.

    The general form of this partial differential equation is

    .. math:: a \frac{\partial f(x,y)}{\partial x}
              + b \frac{\partial f(x,y)}{\partial y} + c f(x,y) = 0

    where `a`, `b` and `c` are constants.

    The general solution is of the form:

    .. math::
        f(x, y) = F(- a y + b x ) e^{- \frac{c (a x + b y)}{a^2 + b^2}}

    and can be found in SymPy with ``pdsolve``::

        >>> from sympy.solvers import pdsolve
        >>> from sympy.abc import x, y, a, b, c
        >>> from sympy import Function, pprint
        >>> f = Function('f')
        >>> u = f(x,y)
        >>> ux = u.diff(x)
        >>> uy = u.diff(y)
        >>> genform = a*ux + b*uy + c*u
        >>> pprint(genform)
          d               d
        a*--(f(x, y)) + b*--(f(x, y)) + c*f(x, y)
          dx              dy

        >>> pprint(pdsolve(genform))
                                 -c*(a*x + b*y)
                                 ---------------

                                     a  + b
