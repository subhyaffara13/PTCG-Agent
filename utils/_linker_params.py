    """
    The linker command usually begins with the compiler
    command (possibly multiple elements), followed by zero or more
    params for shared library building.

    If the LDSHARED env variable overrides the linker command,
    however, the commands may not match.

    Return the best guess of the linker parameters by stripping
    the linker command. If the compiler command does not
    match the linker command, assume the linker command is
    just the first element.
