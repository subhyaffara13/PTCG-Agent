def inter_community_edges(G, partition):
    """Returns the number of inter-community edges for a partition of `G`.
    according to the given
    partition of the nodes of `G`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph.

    partition : iterable of sets of nodes
        This must be a partition of the nodes of `G`.

    The *inter-community edges* are those edges joining a pair of nodes
    in different blocks of the partition.

    Implementation note: this function creates an intermediate graph
    that may require the same amount of memory as that of `G`.
