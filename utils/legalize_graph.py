def legalize_graph(gm: torch.fx.GraphModule) -> torch.fx.GraphModule:
    """
    Replace the graph of the given GraphModule with one that contains the same nodes as the
    original, but in topologically sorted order.

    This is used by the merge_matmul transformation below, which disturbs the topologically sorted
    order of its input GraphModule, so that this order is restored before further transformation.

    Arguments:
        gm: The graph module to topologically sort. It is modified in-place.

    Returns:
        The graph module in-place sorted

    Warning:
        This topological sort is NOT stable, it will NOT preserve the original node order.
        If you need a stable topological sort, use stable_topological_sort instead.
