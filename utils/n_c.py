def nC(n, k=None, replacement=False):
    """Return the number of combinations of ``n`` items taken ``k`` at a time.

    Possible values for ``n``:

        integer - set of length ``n``

        sequence - converted to a multiset internally

        multiset - {element: multiplicity}

    If ``k`` is None then the total of all combinations of length 0
    through the number of items represented in ``n`` will be returned.

    If ``replacement`` is True then a given item can appear more than once
    in the ``k`` items. (For example, for 'ab' sets of 2 would include 'aa',
    'ab', and 'bb'.) The multiplicity of elements in ``n`` is ignored when
    ``replacement`` is True but the total number of elements is considered
    since no element can appear more times than the number of elements in
    ``n``.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.functions.combinatorial.numbers import nC
    >>> from sympy.utilities.iterables import multiset_combinations
    >>> nC(3, 2)
    3
    >>> nC('abc', 2)
    3
    >>> nC('aab', 2)
    2

    When ``replacement`` is True, each item can have multiplicity
    equal to the length represented by ``n``:

    >>> nC('aabc', replacement=True)
    35
    >>> [len(list(multiset_combinations('aaaabbbbcccc', i))) for i in range(5)]
    [1, 3, 6, 10, 15]
    >>> sum(_)
    35

    If there are ``k`` items with multiplicities ``m_1, m_2, ..., m_k``
    then the total of all combinations of length 0 through ``k`` is the
    product, ``(m_1 + 1)*(m_2 + 1)*...*(m_k + 1)``. When the multiplicity
    of each item is 1 (i.e., k unique items) then there are 2**k
    combinations. For example, if there are 4 unique items, the total number
    of combinations is 16:

    >>> sum(nC(4, i) for i in range(5))
    16
