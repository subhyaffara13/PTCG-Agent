def binned_statistic_2d(x, y, values, statistic='mean',
                        bins=10, range=None, expand_binnumbers=False):
    """
    Compute a bidimensional binned statistic for one or more sets of data.

    This is a generalization of a histogram2d function.  A histogram divides
    the space into bins, and returns the count of the number of points in
    each bin.  This function allows the computation of the sum, mean, median,
    or other statistic of the values (or set of values) within each bin.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : (N,) array_like
        A sequence of values to be binned along the first dimension.
    y : (N,) array_like
        A sequence of values to be binned along the second dimension.
    values : (N,) array_like or list of (N,) array_like
        The data on which the statistic will be computed.  This must be
        the same shape as `x`, or a list of sequences - each with the same
        shape as `x`.  If `values` is such a list, the statistic will be
        computed on each independently.
    statistic : str or callable, optional
        The statistic to compute (default is 'mean').
        The following statistics are available:

        * 'mean' : compute the mean of values for points within each bin.
          Empty bins will be represented by NaN.
        * 'std' : compute the standard deviation within each bin. This
          is implicitly calculated with ddof=0.
        * 'median' : compute the median of values for points within each
          bin. Empty bins will be represented by NaN.
        * 'count' : compute the count of points within each bin.  This is
          identical to an unweighted histogram.  `values` array is not
          referenced.
        * 'sum' : compute the sum of values for points within each bin.
          This is identical to a weighted histogram.
        * 'min' : compute the minimum of values for points within each bin.
          Empty bins will be represented by NaN.
        * 'max' : compute the maximum of values for point within each bin.
          Empty bins will be represented by NaN.
        * function : a user-defined function which takes a 1D array of
          values, and outputs a single numerical statistic. This function
          will be called on the values in each bin.  Empty bins will be
          represented by function([]), or NaN if this returns an error.

    bins : int or [int, int] or array_like or [array, array], optional
        The bin specification:

        * the number of bins for the two dimensions (nx = ny = bins),
        * the number of bins in each dimension (nx, ny = bins),
        * the bin edges for the two dimensions (x_edge = y_edge = bins),
        * the bin edges in each dimension (x_edge, y_edge = bins).

        If the bin edges are specified, the number of bins will be,
        (nx = len(x_edge)-1, ny = len(y_edge)-1).

    range : (2,2) array_like, optional
        The leftmost and rightmost edges of the bins along each dimension
        (if not specified explicitly in the `bins` parameters):
        [[xmin, xmax], [ymin, ymax]]. All values outside of this range will be
        considered outliers and not tallied in the histogram.
    expand_binnumbers : bool, optional
        'False' (default): the returned `binnumber` is a shape (N,) array of
        linearized bin indices.
        'True': the returned `binnumber` is 'unraveled' into a shape (2,N)
        ndarray, where each row gives the bin numbers in the corresponding
        dimension.
        See the `binnumber` returned value, and the `Examples` section.

        .. versionadded:: 0.17.0

    Returns
    -------
    statistic : (nx, ny) ndarray
        The values of the selected statistic in each two-dimensional bin.
    x_edge : (nx + 1) ndarray
        The bin edges along the first dimension.
    y_edge : (ny + 1) ndarray
        The bin edges along the second dimension.
    binnumber : (N,) array of ints or (2,N) ndarray of ints
        This assigns to each element of `sample` an integer that represents the
        bin in which this observation falls.  The representation depends on the
        `expand_binnumbers` argument.  See `Notes` for details.

    Notes
    -----
    Binedges:
    All but the last (righthand-most) bin is half-open.  In other words, if
    `bins` is ``[1, 2, 3, 4]``, then the first bin is ``[1, 2)`` (including 1,
    but excluding 2) and the second ``[2, 3)``.  The last bin, however, is
    ``[3, 4]``, which *includes* 4.

    `binnumber`:
    This returned argument assigns to each element of `sample` an integer that
    represents the bin in which it belongs.  The representation depends on the
    `expand_binnumbers` argument. If 'False' (default): The returned
    `binnumber` is a shape (N,) array of linearized indices mapping each
    element of `sample` to its corresponding bin (using row-major ordering).
    Note that the returned linearized bin indices are used for an array with
    extra bins on the outer binedges to capture values outside of the defined
    bin bounds.
    If 'True': The returned `binnumber` is a shape (2,N) ndarray where
    each row indicates bin placements for each dimension respectively.  In each
    dimension, a binnumber of `i` means the corresponding value is between
    (D_edge[i-1], D_edge[i]), where 'D' is either 'x' or 'y'.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> from scipy import stats

    Calculate the counts with explicit bin-edges:

    >>> x = [0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.6]
    >>> y = [2.1, 2.6, 2.1, 2.1]
    >>> binx = [0.0, 0.5, 1.0]
    >>> biny = [2.0, 2.5, 3.0]
    >>> ret = stats.binned_statistic_2d(x, y, None, 'count', bins=[binx, biny])
    >>> ret.statistic
    array([[2., 1.],
           [1., 0.]])

    The bin in which each sample is placed is given by the `binnumber`
    returned parameter.  By default, these are the linearized bin indices:

    >>> ret.binnumber
    array([5, 6, 5, 9])

    The bin indices can also be expanded into separate entries for each
    dimension using the `expand_binnumbers` parameter:

    >>> ret = stats.binned_statistic_2d(x, y, None, 'count', bins=[binx, biny],
    ...                                 expand_binnumbers=True)
    >>> ret.binnumber
    array([[1, 1, 1, 2],
           [1, 2, 1, 1]])

    Which shows that the first three elements belong in the xbin 1, and the
    fourth into xbin 2; and so on for y.
