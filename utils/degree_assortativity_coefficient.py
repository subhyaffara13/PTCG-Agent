    """Compute degree assortativity of graph.

    Assortativity measures the similarity of connections
    in the graph with respect to the node degree.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    x: string ('in','out')
       The degree type for source node (directed graphs only).

    y: string ('in','out')
       The degree type for target node (directed graphs only).

    weight: string or None, optional (default=None)
       The edge attribute that holds the numerical value used
       as a weight.  If None, then each edge has weight 1.
       The degree is the sum of the edge weights adjacent to the node.

    nodes: list or iterable (optional)
        Compute degree assortativity only for nodes in container.
        The default is all nodes.

    Returns
    -------
    r : float
       Assortativity of graph by degree.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.path_graph(4)
    >>> r = nx.degree_assortativity_coefficient(G)
    >>> print(f"{r:3.1f}")
    -0.5

    numeric_assortativity_coefficient

    degree_mixing_matrix

    Notes
    -----
    This computes Eq. (21) in Ref. [1]_ , where e is the joint
    probability distribution (mixing matrix) of the degrees.  If G is
    directed than the matrix e is the joint probability of the
    user-specified degree type for the source and target.
