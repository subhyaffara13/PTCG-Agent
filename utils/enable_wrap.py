    """
    Context manager to wrap modules using a wrapper.

    Useful for when you'd like to apply the same configuration arguments to all
    child modules that you wrap. A particularly important use case is wrapping
    large layers so that they get sharded (in-place) during initialization, to
    avoid running out of system memory. Large layers can indicate that they
    should be sharded via the ``wrap`` annotation and this context manager can
    provide the exact configuration for these nested instances.

    Usage::

        with enable_wrap(wrapper_cls, **params):
            # Wraps layer in FSDP by default if within context
            self.l1 = wrap(torch.nn.Linear(5, 5))

    Args:
        wrapper_cls:
            Class that `wrap` annotation will `wrap` modules with, such as
            `FullyShardedDataParallel`.
        **wrapper_kwargs:
            Configuration settings that will be passed to all ``wrap``
            instances inside the context
    """
    kwargs = {
        "wrapper_cls": wrapper_cls,
        **wrapper_kwargs,
    }
    with _ConfigAutoWrap(**kwargs):
        yield
